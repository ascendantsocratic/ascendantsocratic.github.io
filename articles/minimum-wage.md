## Monopsony and Effects on Firms

There are three schools of thought when it comes to the minimum wage debate. All of these emphasize the importance of the responses that firms have to minimum wage increases as a determinant of the actual effects of minimum wages. The major two, the competitive and monopsonistic model, are in opposition as to whether a minimum wage can meaningfully improve the lives of workers.

The competitive model, which is commonly taught in basic economics courses, assumes as the name suggests that markets are perfectly competitive and always at an optimal equilibrium. A consequence of any minimum wage change will be higher unemployment and consequently an increased labor supply, due to firms being unable to afford a higher wage for their workers. This brings the market into disequilibrium and harms all parties involved [(Wilson, 2012)](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf). There is some evidence that the competitive model accurately describes the situation with the minimum wage. Firm exit is one piece of evidence which provides support for this model. If firms exist in a competitive market in which each firm has zero or near zero profit, we would expect to see that minimum wage increases would result in firms leaving, particularly lower-quality firms closer to the margin of exit. Data has shown this to be accurate [(Luca & Luca, 2017)](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33111775/17-088.pdf;jsessionid=DFC2E1554F19FAD9B623717C22136BAC?sequence=1).

The second major model of the effects of a minimum wage on firm behavior is the monopsonistic or oligopsonistic model. Whereas a monopoly is a situation in which there is only one seller within a particular market, a monopsony is a situation in which there is only one buyer within a particular market. Firms are buyers within the labor market, and can thus theoretically operate as monopsonies. In the case of a monopsony, markets are not perfectly competitive, and firms have more market power. This means that they have an ability to set wages, and will deliberately avoid purchasing until the equilibrium level to hold down their own prices [(Young, 2023)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopsony.asp). Given that wages are deliberately set below the equilibrium level, those who subscribe to the monopsony model would assert that an effectively set minimum wage would enable the market price to equal the equilibrium price, ensuring that workers are paid more without increasing their levels of unemployment. Interestingly, the monopsony model actually predicts a small increase in employment as a consequence of an effectively set minimum wage, because it increases the supply of labor without preventing firms from purchasing that labor [(Wilson, 2012)](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf), assuming the price floor is not set too high. If it is, the monopsonist will reduce its purchases within the labor market and inefficiency occurs [(Boal & Ransom, 2002)](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/monopsony-in-american-labor-markets/). Given that a monopsony is generally nonexistent in the real world, the term "oligopsony" is often used in the empirical literature to refer to a set of a few firms which generally operate in the same way as a monopsony does.

There is a fair amount of evidence that monopsonistic/oligopsonistic models have some merit to them as well. Some firms, such as those in the tomato market have been observed exhibiting oligopsonistic characteristics [(Just & Chern, 1980)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3003381), amongst others [(Boal & Ransom, 2002)](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/monopsony-in-american-labor-markets/).

In terms of the effects of minimum wage on unemployment, there is a wide literature which all appears to disagree amongst itself about the effects of the minimum wage on unemployment. However, it generally suggests that there is a null or slightly negative effect of the minimum wage on employment. This is to some extent consistent with both competitive and monopsonistic models of the minimum wage, as the effects of minimum wages don't seem to go super hard either way. This could be due in part to the degrees to which different low-wage labor markets are competitive or monopsonistic. This is discussed in later sections.

It has been found that firm profitability decreases following increases in the minimum wage. Interestingly, this is neither evidence in favor of or against either the competitive or monopsonistic model of the minimum wage, as both would naturally predict a reduction in profitability from the minimum wage [(Draca et al., 2011;](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25760249?seq=1) [Babiak et al., 2019)](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/203233/1/1667730924.pdf).

A third often not mentioned model of the minimum wage is the institutional/behavioral model. This model suggests that the situation with the minimum wage is a bit more complex than a competitive model would suggest, with cost absorptions occurring in a variety of areas as opposed to strictly employment. These can include reducing sales, improving service, economic expansion, and changes in internal wage structure. Moderate minimum wage increases are said to have no employment effect or a positive employment effect [(Wilson, 2012)](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf). There is also some evidence for this model, with channels of adjustment for minimum wages including some factors which are consistent with the institutional/behavioral model, including wage compression and higher performance standards. Because of this, a minimum wage's firm-related effects can be said to go beyond simply employment [(Hirsch et al., 2011)](https://docs.iza.org/dp6132.pdf).

In sum, all three major models for how the minimum wage operates have some degree of merit to them, and we will examine the effects of the minimum wage as they apply to all of these models when looking at the channels of adjustment that firms engage in following minimum wage increases in more detail.

## Channels of Adjustment

### Employment

Polling suggests that economists are split on whether the minimum wage causes adverse unemployment effects, or at least whether they make it harder for low-skilled workers to find employment [(Clark center Forum, 2013)](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/minimum-wage/). When looking at the actual empirical evidence on the subject, this starts to make more sense, as there is no consensus on the subject. Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of the evidence according to meta-analytic research suggests there is no net effect of the minimum wage on employment or a small negative effect, even without taking into account publication bias which leans in favor of studies which find a negative effect of the minimum wage on employment [(Doucouliagos & Stanley, 2009;]([https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1403498](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8543.2009.00723.x)) [Hafner et al., 2016;](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/601139/The_impact_of_the_NMW_on_employment_-_a_meta-analysis.pdf) [Sonn & Lanthrop, 2016)](https://www.nelp.org/publication/raise-wages-kill-jobs-no-correlation-minimum-wage-increases-employment-levels/). All of this is done even while also increasing the wage of workers, as minimum wage laws intend to do. The broader economic effects of minimum wage workers will be discussed in more detail later on, but keep this in mind [(Reich et al., 2017)](https://irle.berkeley.edu/seattles-minimum-wage-experience-2015-16/).

In terms of measurements of the precise elasticities of employment as a result of an increase in the minimum wage, the literature generally suggests that it is around -0.1, particularly with the more recent research on the subject. This means that a 1% increase in the minimum wage would be expected to decrease employment by 0.1%, a very small decrease [(Brown et al., 1982;](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2724487?seq=38#metadata_info_tab_contents) [Dube, 2019;](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/844350/impacts_of_minimum_wages_review_of_the_international_evidence_Arindrajit_Dube_web.pdf) [Wolfson & Belman, 2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/labr.12162). It is important to recognize, however, that these effects vary depending on which study you look at. For example, one study estimated an elasticity of around -0.7. Whether this is due to differences in methodology used, the nature of the markets that the minimum wage changes are situated in, or simply statistical noise, is difficult to say. Still, the evidence is overwhelmingly in support of an elasticity estimate of 0.1 [(Sabia et al., 2012)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254583157_Are_the_Effects_of_Minimum_Wage_Increases_Always_Small_New_Evidence_from_a_Case_Study_of_New_York_State). Additionally, [Clemens & Wither (2014)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w20724) looked at the minimum wage in the context of the great recession, and found a significant negative effect of the minimum wage on employment and income growth. Given that recessions are often characterized by low profit margins, it would make sense that firms in labor markets would act in a manner more consistent with the competitive model and end up laying off more workers, reducing their income growth. I would naturally expect that the effects of a minimum wage would thus be worse in the context of a recession, so this result does not surprise me.

There is some literature which looks at the reasons for why this might be the case. One study for example found a substitution effect where highly productive teenagers have increased levels of employment and adults have decreased levels of employment as a result of minimum wages [Giuliano (2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254429129_Minimum_Wage_Effects_on_Employment_Substitution_and_the_Teenage_Labor_Supply_Evidence_from_Personnel_Data). However, given a wealth of data which suggests that teen employment is either unaffected or slightly reduced as a consequence of minimum wages [(Allegretto et al., 2013;](https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2011/Do-Minimum-Wages-Really-Reduce-Teen-Employment.pdf) [Cengiz, 2021)](http://tankona.free.fr/nber28399.pdf), it is unlikely that this is a widespread case, if a case at all.

One study looked at how the minimum wage affects labor markets of different concentrations, and finds that there is variance in the employment effects of the minimum wage and how concentrated a particular labor market is [(Azar et al., 2019)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26101/w26101.pdf). More concentrated labor markets which would act more monopsonistically have more positive employment effects, whereas less concentrated labor markets which would act more competitively have more negative employment effects. The new effect ends up balancing to zero. This is consistent with the idea that both competitive and monopsonistic models of the minimum wage have some level of merit to them. Moreover, if it is the case that the proportions of differently concentrated labor markets vary across time and geographical region, it could potentially explain the differing results that come up from the minimum wage literature.

Another important question to examine is the long-term effects of minimum wages on unemployment, which there is some data on. It appears that there may be slightly larger long-term effects of the minimum wage on unemployment [(Meer & West, 2016;](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24736030#metadata_info_tab_contents) [Allegretto et al., 2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0019793917692788), although these are also small.

While it is the case that the empirical evidence suggests little to no adverse effects of the minimum wage on employment, it is nonetheless undeniable that a sufficiently large minimum wage would have adverse employment effects. This is something which both proponents of the competitive and monopsony model can agree on. Because of this, it is useful to examine when a minimum wage goes too far in its adverse effects, [Dube (2019)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/844350/impacts_of_minimum_wages_review_of_the_international_evidence_Arindrajit_Dube_web.pdf) reviewed the literature and found that employment effects appear to be small up until around 59% of the median wage.

### Prices

Another important concern is whether minimum wage increases are absorbed by price increases. The majority of the literature suggests that the price increases are fairly small in general [(Lemos, 2004;](https://docs.iza.org/dp1072.pdf) [2008;](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6419.2007.00532.x) [McClure, 2015;](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/study-raising-wages-to-15-an-hour-for-limited-service-restaurant-employees-would-raise-prices-4.3-percent.html) [Allegretto & Reich, 2016;](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/24t5h934) [Renkin et al., 2020)](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/The_Pass-Through_of_Minimum_Wages_into_US_Retail_Price.pdf). This suggests that minimum wages generally transfer money from firms or consumers to low-income consumers, meaning it is progressive. This appears to depend on the size of the hike, which is consistent with the monopsony model. Small minimum wage hikes do not lead to higher prices, while large minimum wage hikes do [(MacDonald & Nilsson, 2016)](https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=up_workingpapers).

It should be acknowledged that the distributional effects of the minimum wage when taking this into account are progressive, but fairly small. This is because of the potential negative effects of the minimum wage on employment, the fact that minimum wages affect different income quintiles roughly the same (as the share of families with a minimum wage worker is roughly the same across income quintiles), and the natural price increases from a minimum wage. This translates into a moderate benefit for lower-income consumers but a substantial deadweight loss on the whole [(Sherk, 2017)](https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2017-01/BG3160_0.pdf). This isn't inherently a bad thing, as most taxes in general produce deadweight losses, but it is important to note as a drawback. The effect that a minimum wage hike will have on prices does appear to depend on policy design. Minimum wages indexed to a price measure appear to have a lower pass-through effect [MacDonald & Nilsson, 2016](https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=up_workingpapers). I'd imagine that a minimum wage indexed on the median hourly wage would be similar in effect, and as discussed before, it appears that one pegged to 59% of the median hourly wage would have the greatest positive effect before getting into negative employment effects.

In short, price increases are important to consider but not sufficient to justify the notion that the minimum wage is inherently bad. While I did not find any data pertaining to how price levels would change as a minimum wage continues to increase, I would imagine it'd be roughly similar to the 59% of median wage number that a study found on employment. I suspect this because if employment effects don't become notable until 59% of the median wage, it is likely the case that some monopsonistic effects are operating until roughly that threshold, in which case not only is there less of a necessity to decrease employment at lower minimum wage levels, but there is less of a necessity to engage in other profit-maximizing measures, such as price hikes either. Due to this, I would consider this literature consistent with the idea that a minimum wage should be hiked to be roughly 59% of the median hourly wage.

### Labor Market Changes

Consistent with the notion that neither the monopsony nor the competitive model can fully explain minimum wage effects, I found fairly contradictory evidence on how labor market flows are affected by the minimum wage, with some research suggesting increased labor market flows [(Dustmann et al., 2019)](http://sarkoups.free.fr/dustmann719.pdf) and some suggesting decreased labor market flows [(Dube et al., 2016)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/685449). My suspicion is that the effects likely vary by industry and also by location as most minimum wage effects appear to vary. [(Ku, 2020)](https://docs.iza.org/dp13369.pdf) suggests that the minimum wage increases labor productivity, which could arguably be due to either a monopsony or competitive model. I think in either case it makes sense why workers would want to improve their productivity, as they are potentially at risk of being squeezed out of the market, even in some cases with a monopsony model. Research on the levels of absenteeism is also consistent with the idea that workers are likely pressured to some extent as a consequence of minimum wage increases, as they often risk getting unemployed [(Bucila & Simon, 2010)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1588294). The minimum wage also has a variety of other effects on the labor market, which are also due to cost pressures [(Wilson, 2012)](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf):

-   Increasing the likelihood and duration of unemployment for low-wage workers, particularly during economic downturns

-   Encouraging employers to cut worker training

-   Increasing job turnover

-   Discouraging part-time work and reducing school attendance

-   Driving workers into uncovered jobs, reducing wages in those sectors

-   Encouraging employers to cut back on fringe benefits

-   Encouraging employers to install labor-saving devices

-   Increasing inflationary pressure

-   Increasing teenage crime rates as a result of higher unemployment

-   Encouraging workers to hire illegal aliens.

-   Another channel of adjustment is labor-labor substitution within businesses, where some employers will replace their lowest-skilled workers with somewhat higher-skilled workers in response to increases in the minimum wage. Unions are strong supporters of minimum wages because of this reduction in competition.

Much of this research is consistent with the competitive model, although results from the monopsonistic model creep in as well. It does appear, however, that the competitive model is better at explaining how channels of adjustment operate following minimum wage hikes.

## Quality of Life Effects

### Poverty and Wages

Much of the research on the relationship between the minimum wage and poverty/workers wages appears to rest on the debate of how the minimum wage would affect employment. Given the conflicting research on that question, it is of no surprise that there is conflicting research on the issue of how the minimum wage affects poverty and wages [(Addison & Blackburn, 1998;](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/24285/1/dp4298.pdf) [Dube et al., 2010;](https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2010/Minimum-Wage-Effects-Across-State-Borders.pdf) [Dube, 2014)](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf)
. However, if it is the case that the minimum wage has few unemployment effects until a certain threshold, which was established is likely around 59% of the median hourly wage, it stands to reason that poverty would likely decrease until roughly that point, at which it would start to reverse. The specific numbers of this may vary depending on a range of factors, but it makes sense that this would be the case.

Further complicating this issue however is the question of who benefits from the minimum wage, which does seem to be disproportionately the poor as suggested by data on minimum wages and prices [(Sabia & Burkhauser, 2010;](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4284/sej.2010.76.3.592) [Wilson, 2012)](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf). However, as stated before the minimum wage is only moderately progressive. If my hypothesis is correct that the effects of the minimum wage is beneficial up until a certain threshold, it would help to explain the generally sympathetic views that economists have towards the minimum wage according to polling [(Clark center Forum, 2013)](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/minimum-wage/).

### Wealth Inequality

The minimum wage appears to decrease general income inequality, consistent with the idea that it increases the income of people while having little to no unemployment effects [(Autor et al., 2016;]([https://economics.mit.edu/files/11561](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20140073)) [Dube, 2017)](https://ftp.iza.org/dp10572.pdf). However, once again, this appears to potentially reverse itself when it reaches a maximum effectiveness value. [Litwin (2015)](https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1388&context=student_scholarship) found a result of a maximum effectiveness value of $11.77 across OECD countries, which appears roughly consistent with the 59% maximum before large unemployment effects occur. This doesn't mean that all poorer parties benefit. For example, poorer bosses appear to suffer more from the minimum wage [(Neumark, 2020)](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/01/04/a-study-suggests-that-higher-minimum-wages-hit-poorer-bosses-pockets). This is consistent with research shown earlier about how the minimum wage pushes less successful businesses out of the market, given that they have lower profit margins. Still, overall the minimum wage reduces wealth inequality.

### Health

In general, the minimum wage has been found to have positive health effects, including reduced mortality [(Tsao et al., 2016)](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303188), suicides [(Dow et al., 2019](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25787/w25787.pdf) [The Economist, 2020)](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/01/20/higher-minimum-wages-are-linked-to-lower-suicide-rates)
, and BMI [(Meltzer & Chen, 2009)](https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/w15485.pdf), as well as increased subjective well-being [(Flavin & Shufeldt, 2016)](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.baylor.edu/dist/2/1297/files/2010/09/Minimum_Wage_SWB_3.7.16_PF-293y1ob.pdf) and life expectancy [(Lenhart, 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27844176/). This is consistent with the idea that the minimum wage generally alleviates economic hardship for those who are most at risk of poor health conditions in society.

### Education

There is research suggesting that minimum wage increases have a small but positive impact on education [(Sutch, 2010)](https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/w16355.pdf). Given that the posited mechanism for this result is that unemployment increases as a consequence of the minimum wage which causes teenagers to become more educated to increase their job prospects, I'd imagine this is generally a null or small effect.

### Crime

Research on crime suggests that the minimum wage can have positive or negative effects on crime, depending on whether the increase has notable effects on the unemployment rate relative to the wage increase [(White House, 2016;](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160423_cea_incarceration_criminal_justice.pdf) [Agan & Makowsky, 2018;](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25116/w25116.pdf) [Fone et al., 2019)](https://epionline.org/app/uploads/2019/03/EPI_MinimumWageReducingCrimeStudy_Final-2.pdf). Due to this, it is likely the case that crime effects are roughly positive or null until the 59% threshold outlined earlier.

## Other Economic Effects

Due to causing increases in spending, a minimum wage hike appears to increase economic growth [(Cooper, 2013;](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-federal-minimum-wage-to-1010/) [Cooper et al., 2019)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25761#:~:text=Using%20variation%20in%20minimum%20wages,and%20nominal%20spending%20rise%20modestly.). As with policies which increase aggregate spending in general, however, this is likely to be a short-term effect of a hike as opposed to a long-term consequence of having a minimum wage in place. In the long-term, it is likely the case that a minimum wage has roughly null effects on economic growth.

## Racism

Historically, minimum wage laws have been advocated by some as a means to push black people out of the labor market through increasing the pressure of businesses to reduce their employment of low-skilled labor, which was and still is disproportionately black [(Calton, 2017)](https://mises.org/wire/racist-history-minimum-wage-laws).

Interestingly however, these policies appear to have had the opposite effect that was expected. While I have previously documented research on the effects of the minimum wage on broad inequality, there is also some on racial inequality specifically, which finds that minimum wages have reduced racial inequality where implemented [(Derenoncourt & Montialoux, 2021;](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/1/169/5905427) [Wursten et al., 2021)](https://irle.berkeley.edu/racial-inequality-and-minimum-wages-in-frictional-labor-markets/). Therefore, it is more accurate to suggest that a minimum wage reduces racism rather than exacerbating it, although I would argue this shouldn't be framed in terms of racism.

## In Developing Countries

An interesting question to examine is how the minimum wage would work in developing countries which are characterized by significantly higher levels of low-wage labor. In these contexts, the minimum wage also appears to be effective in reducing poverty [(Margolis, 2014;](https://wol.iza.org/articles/introducing-a-statutory-minimum-wage-in-middle-and-low-income-countries) [Gindling, 2018)](https://wol.iza.org/articles/does-increasing-the-minimum-wage-reduce-poverty-in-developing-countries/long). As for the threshold of a minimum wage, I'd imagine 59% of the median wage could work, although I am not super confident on this just due to how these types of labor markets likely operate significantly differently compared to those in developed countries where minimum wage effects are typically studied. Importantly, institutional mechanisms must be in place to actually enforce a minimum wage in order for it to be effective, which is a concern in developing countries where rule of law is more questionable in some contexts to say the least.
