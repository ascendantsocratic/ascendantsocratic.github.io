## G Factor

Cognitive function tests are measurement invariant across groups [(Taylor & Ziegler, 1987;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/001316448704700318)  [Kaufman et al., 1995;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/0013164495055003001)  [Pandolfi, 1997;](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/1997-pandolfi.pdf)  [Barnes et al., 2016)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617715001113), meaning that the tests can be used to assess cognition among racial groups.

Spearman's g factor has also been demonstrated to exist across a multitude of nations, strongly suggesting that it is a universal phenomenon [(Rindermann, 2007;](https://emilkirkegaard.dk//en/wp-content/uploads/The-g-factor-of-international-cognitive-ability-comparisons-the-homogeneity-of-results-in-PISA-TIMSS-PIRLS-and-IQ-tests-across-nations.pdf)  [Warne & Burningham, 2019)](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-01683-001.pdf).

The g factor also exists amongst chimpanzees, and the more g-loaded cognitive abilities had more genetic variance and phenotypic variance and were more heritable, suggesting it is associated with high interspecies variance and evolves rapidly [(Woodley et al., 2015)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.04.002).

## Heritability

There exist no ethnic differences in the heritability of intelligence [(Pesta et al., 2020)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2019.101408).

## Stereotype Threat

There exists strong publication bias in the stereotype threat literature which suggests that there may be a null effect of stereotype threat on performance [(Zigerell, 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28795832/). Given that research in other sections suggests that IQ tests are measurement invariant across groups, I would suspect that the effect of stereotype threat is either small or null.

## National IQs

There is a positive correlation between national IQ score and innovation [(Azam, 2017)](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/76922/). Nations with higher average intelligence are more liberal (greater highest marginal individual tax rate and thus lower economic inequality), are less religious, and are more monogamous. Average intelligence appears to be the strongest predictor of these traits [(Kanazawa, 2009)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/abs/iq-and-the-values-of-nations/B28886FC682668151084DF2E9DC5C0AF).

## Test Bias

The black-white IQ gap is larger on "non-cultural" test items compared to "cultural" test items because non-cultural items require more sheer reasoning ability than cultural items [(Jensen & McGurk, 1986)](http://arthurjensen.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Black-White-Bias-in-Cultural-and-Noncultural-Test-Items-1987-by-Arthur-Robert-Jensen-Frank-C.-J.-McGurk.pdf).

## Climatic Variables

Across African and Eurasian countries, nasal index, lower precipitation, and lower temperature are all positively associated with IQ [(Templer & Stephens, 2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264085536_The_relationship_between_IQ_and_climatic_variables_in_African_and_Eurasian_countries). However, temperature strongly predicts American state IQ, suggesting that evolution is not necessary for temperature and IQ to meaningfully co-vary [(Pesta & Poznanski, 2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289614001019#:~:text=CWT%20proposes%20that%20race%20differences,selection%20premium%20on%20higher%20IQ.).

Exposure to infectious disease is a strong predictor of IQ across both American states and across countries internationally [(Eppig, 2011)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-average-iq-higher-in-some-places/).

Hominid brain evolution since Homo Habilis between 1.9 million to 10 thousand years ago has been driven by population density, variation in paleoclimate, and temperature variation [(Bailey & Geary, 2009)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-008-9054-0).

## Expert Opinion

Only 16% of experts on intelligence believe in a 100% environmental explanation for the black-white difference in IQ [(Rindermann et al., 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289619301886).

## Socioeconomics

Black-white IQ gaps do not go away when SES is controlled for, but also IQ also determines SES so it is fallacious to assume that there is a unidirectional effect of SES on IQ [(Neisser et al., 1996)](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IntUnknown.pdf).

## Brain Size

Contemporary differences in racial IQs can be identified as far back as 10,000 years ago from differences in brain size [(Lynn, 2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886909003882?via%3Dihub).

Races differ in mean cranial capacities, with Asians at the highest, then Europeans, and then Africans at the lowest [(Rushton & Rushton, 2003)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00137-X). The relation between brain size and cognitive ability increases from Africans to Europeans to Asians [(Rushton & Ankney, 1996)](https://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brain-Size-and-Cognitive-Ability-Correlations-with-Age-Sex-Social-Class-and-Race-1996-by-John-Philippe-Rushton-C.-Davison-Ankney.pdf).

## Cortical Structure

MRI analysis indicates significant brain differences between caucasian and indian people [(Rao et al., 2017)](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/yalavarthy/Rao_Psyn_2017.pdf).

Three-dimensional geometry of the cortical surface is highly predictive of individuals' genetic ancestry. It also shows distinct ancestral patterns in the folding and gyrification of the brain [(Fan et al., 2015)](https://files.catbox.moe/d8gdf7.pdf).

Resting state functional MRI connectivity data can predict genetic ancestry at very high performance [(Altmann & Miranda, 2018)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/440776v1.full.pdf).

Many of the amino acid polymorphic sites from the brain size regulating gene CASC5 have high frequencies of derived alleles in East Asians, but are rare in Europeans and Africans. This suggests that there was natural selection that tended to favor a larger gray matter volume in East Asians [(Shi et al., 2016)](https://files.catbox.moe/dmg1zr.pdf).

[Kirkegaard & Fuerst (2023)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369479241_A_Multimodal_MRI-based_Predictor_of_Intelligence_and_Its_Relation_to_RaceEthnicity) found that when applying a multimodal MRI-based predictor of intelligence, race can confound models when a multiracial training sample is used because models learn to predict race and use race to predict intelligence

## GWAS

Alleles exhibiting significant and replicable positive associations with IQ are strongly correlated with country-level IQ. Allele frequencies varied by continents in a way corresponding to population differences in intelligence [(Piffer, 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289615001087?via%3Dihub).

A polygenic score for educational attainment, cognitive ability, and self-rated mathematical ability has been found to be higher amongst Jews compared to Catholics and Lutherans [(Dunkel et al., 2019)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330601752_Polygenic_Scores_Mediate_the_Jewish_Phenotypic_Advantage_in_Educational_Attainment_and_Cognitive_Ability_Compared_With_Catholics_and_Lutherans). However, [Freese et al. (2019)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334385807_Problems_with_a_Causal_Interpretation_of_Polygenic_Score_Differences_between_Jewish_and_non-Jewish_Respondents_in_the_Wisconsin_Longitudinal_Study) points out that the polygenic score differences would lead one to significantly overestimate the disparity in IQ that exists in reality, suggesting that one should be careful when interpreting group polygenic score differences.

In general, it can be problematic to draw causal explanations of polygenic score differences between ancestral groups, because polygenic score differences can often make predictions between groups that don't fare in reality [(Rosenberg et al., 2019)](https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/26/5262222). For example, polygenic score differences would predict that West Africans are much shorter than Europeans, when this isn't the case [(Freese et al., 2019)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334385807_Problems_with_a_Causal_Interpretation_of_Polygenic_Score_Differences_between_Jewish_and_non-Jewish_Respondents_in_the_Wisconsin_Longitudinal_Study).

Polygenic scores for educational attainment and intelligence were found to correlate with population differences in IQ, with Asian populations at the highest, followed by Europeans, followed by Africans [(Piffer, 2019)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332076417_Evidence_for_Recent_Polygenic_Selection_on_Educational_Attainment_and_Intelligence_Inferred_from_Gwas_Hits_A_Replication_of_Previous_Findings_Using_Recent_Data).

## Racism

The black-white IQ gap tends to be smaller in counties with more republicans, more white people, and higher implicit anti-black racism. This suggests that systemic racism does not explain racial gaps in IQ tests [(Kirkegaard, 2023)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377204444_Systemic_Racism_Does_Not_Explain_Variation_in_Race_Gaps_on_Cognitive_Tests).

## Taboo

Race and IQ is a more taboo topic than even topics such as incest and pedophilia [(Pesta et al., 2024)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379846490_Is_Research_on_the_Genetics_of_Race_IQ_Gaps_Mythically_Taboo).

## Racial Classifications

### Expert Opinion

The concept of race is generally rejected amongst anthropologists in the United States and Canada. Rejection is moderate in Europe, sizable in Poland and Cuba, and lowest in Russia and China. This suggests that there is cross-country variation in rejecting the race concept without global consensus [(Lieberman et al., 2004)](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/8770).

### Clustering or Gradients

Looking at a single loci of an individual, there is a relatively high probability of racial misclassification of the individual. This drops to zero when looking at a sufficiently large number of loci [(Edwards, 2003)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12879450/#:~:text=Abstract,between%20populations%20or%20ethnic%20groups). Thus, while the vast majority of genetic variation exists between members of a human population or ethnic group, this does not imply that one may be more genetically similar to a member of another group than a member of one's own.

Genetic cluster analysis suggests that human population clusters correspond closely to predefined regional or population groups or to collections of geographically and linguistically similar populations. Predefined labels of ancestry were very informative about membership in genetic clusters, even for intermediate populations. For many applications in epidemiology therefore, self-reported population ancestry can be very useful for inferring genetic ancestry [(Rosenberg et al., 2002)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1078311).

Self-reported racial/ethnic group identity almost perfectly corresponds to genetic cluster membership [(Tang et al., 2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1196372/).

There exists a positive correlation between novelty-seeking DRD4 polymorphisms and human migration distance out of Africa [(Matthews & Butler, 2011)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajpa.21507?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false).

### Phrenology and Craniometry

Head size correlates with IQ [(Pietschnig et al., 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014976341500250X). There are race differences in head size, and white and black children matched on IQ show on average no difference in head size [(Jensen & Johnson, 1994)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0160289694900329).

Craniometry, which is the measurement of head size, is different from phrenology which looks at scalp morphology. Scalp morphology cannot be used to infer levels of brain function in the healthy population [(Jones et al., 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945218301436).
