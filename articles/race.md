## G Factor

Cognitive function tests are measurement invariant across groups [(Taylor & Ziegler, 1987;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/001316448704700318)  [Kaufman et al., 1995;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/0013164495055003001)  [Pandolfi, 1997;](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/1997-pandolfi.pdf)  [Barnes et al., 2016)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617715001113), meaning that the tests can be used to assess cognition among racial groups.

Spearman's g factor has also been demonstrated to exist across a multitude of nations, strongly suggesting that it is a universal phenomenon [(Rindermann, 2007;](https://emilkirkegaard.dk//en/wp-content/uploads/The-g-factor-of-international-cognitive-ability-comparisons-the-homogeneity-of-results-in-PISA-TIMSS-PIRLS-and-IQ-tests-across-nations.pdf)  [Warne & Burningham, 2019)](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-01683-001.pdf).

The g factor also exists amongst chimpanzees, and the more g-loaded cognitive abilities had more genetic variance and phenotypic variance and were more heritable, suggesting it is associated with high interspecies variance and evolves rapidly [(Woodley et al., 2015)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.04.002).

## Heritability

There exist no ethnic differences in the heritability of intelligence [(Pesta et al., 2020)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2019.101408).

## Stereotype Threat

There exists strong publication bias in the stereotype threat literature which suggests that there may be a null effect of stereotype threat on performance [(Zigerell, 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28795832/). Given that research in other sections suggests that IQ tests are measurement invariant across groups, I would suspect that the effect of stereotype threat is either small or null.

## National IQs

There is a positive correlation between national IQ score and innovation [(Azam, 2017)](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/76922/). Nations with higher average intelligence are more liberal (greater highest marginal individual tax rate and thus lower economic inequality), are less religious, and are more monogamous. Average intelligence appears to be the strongest predictor of these traits [(Kanazawa, 2009)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/abs/iq-and-the-values-of-nations/B28886FC682668151084DF2E9DC5C0AF).

## Test Bias

The black-white IQ gap is larger on "non-cultural" test items compared to "cultural" test items because non-cultural items require more sheer reasoning ability than cultural items [(Jensen & McGurk, 1986)](http://arthurjensen.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Black-White-Bias-in-Cultural-and-Noncultural-Test-Items-1987-by-Arthur-Robert-Jensen-Frank-C.-J.-McGurk.pdf).
