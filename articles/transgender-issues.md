## Transition

### Social

**Supported social transition, including chosen name use, improves the mental health of transgender people.**

[The Mental Health of Transgender Youth: Advances in Understanding](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X1630146X)

- Systematic literature review of 15 studies
- Finds that transgender youth have higher rates of depression, suicidality and self harm, and eating disorders compared to their peers.
- Gender-affirming therapy and supported social transition in childhood correlate with improved psychosocial functioning for trans children and adolescents.

[Chosen Name Use Is Linked to Reduced Depressive Symptoms, Suicidal Ideation, and Suicidal Behavior Among Transgender Youth](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(18)30085-5/fulltext)

- Finds that after adjusting for personal characteristics and social support, chosen name in more contexts was associated with lower depression, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior.

[Gender Identity 5 Years After Social Transition](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/2/e2021056082/186992/Gender-Identity-5-Years-After-Social-Transition?autologincheck=redirected?nfToken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

- Looks at rate of retransition and gender identities after 5 years among 317 initially transgender youth with a mean starting age of 8.1.
- Finds that 7.3% of youth retransitioned at least once, with later cisgender identities becoming more common among youth whose initial social transition was before 6 years of age. These retransitions often occurred before age 10.

[Mental Health and Self-Worth in Socially Transitioned Transgender Youth](https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext)

- _"Transgender children reported depression and self-worth that did not differ from their matched-control or sibling peers (p = .311), and they reported marginally higher anxiety (p = .076). Compared with national averages, transgender children showed typical rates of depression (p = .290) and marginally higher rates of anxiety (p = .096). Parents similarly reported that their transgender children experienced more anxiety than children in the control groups (p = .002) and rated their transgender children as having equivalent levels of depression (p = .728)."_

### Medical

The vast majority of the evidence suggests that gender transition improves gender dysphoria, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and sexual function [(Pfäfflin & Junge, 1998;](https://web.archive.org/web/20070812100135/http://www.symposion.com:80/ijt/pfaefflin/6002-6.htm#Treatment%20Results)  [Murad et al., 2009;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19473181/)  [Manrique et al., 2018;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29489533/)  [What We Know Project, 2018:](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/)  [Weinforth et al., 2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6546862/).

This is the case with short-term follow-ups [(Cohen-Kettenis & Goozen, 1997;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9031580/)  [Rauchfleisch & Battegay, 1998;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9789272/)  [Smith et al., 2001;](https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(09)60397-X/fulltext)  [Vries et al., 2014;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25201798/)  [Lindqvist et al., 2016;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00238-016-1252-0)  [Grift et al., 2017;](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0092623X.2017.1326190)  [Tordoff et al., 2022)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423) , as well as medium- to long-term follow-ups [(Lindemalm et al., 1986; ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01542412)[Cuypere et al., 2005;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-005-7926-5)  [(Cuypere et al., 2006;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1158136006000491?via%3Dihub)  [Johansson et al., 2010;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-009-9551-1)  [Ruppin & Pfafflin, 2015;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0453-5)  [Branstrom & Pachankis, 2019)](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19010080).

Regret rates following sex reassignment are very low, estimated to be between 0.3%-3.8% [(Manrique et al., 2018;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29489533/)  [What We Know Project, 2018)](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/). Note that when it comes to surgical decision making in general, self-reported patient regret has an average prevalence across studies of 14.4% [(Wilson et al., 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28243695/), meaning that the regret rate for sex reassignment is shockingly low relative to other surgeries.

### Hormonal

Evidence suggests that mental health and quality of life improves for transgender people following cross-sex hormonal treatment [(Newfield et al., 2006;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-006-0002-3)  [Reisner et al., 2016;](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/trgh.2015.0008)  [Nobili et al., 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6223813/), although there are considerations which should be made concerning bone and cardiovascular health [(Wierckx et al., 2013;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1743609515337802)  [Weinand & Safer, 2015;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5226129/)  [Unger, 2016;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5182227/)  [Fighera et al., 2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469959/). Few transgender people regret undergoing hormone therapy [(Levy et al., 2003)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2265.2003.01821.x). Gender-affirming hormones have no adverse cognitive effects [(Karalexi et al., 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453020301402?via%3Dihub).

### Puberty Blockers

Puberty suppression has positive effects on psychological well-being for transgender adolescents, decreasing suicidality in adulthood and improving social life [(Meisen et al., 2020;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X20300276)  [Rew et al., 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33320999/). In the long-run, there doesn't appear to be significant negative side effects of puberty suppression [(Thornton et al., 2014)](https://europepmc.org/article/med/24719967), although there have been some reports [(Gallagher et al., 2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29551430/) meaning they are mostly reversible. Regret rates are low for this type of treatment [(Brik et al., 2020)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-020-01660-8.pdf). Moreover, puberty blockers reduce dysphoria and reduce the invasiveness of future surgeries [(Giordano & Holm, 2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26895269.2020.1747768).\
There is mixed evidence on whether puberty blockers reduce cognitive ability which I would have to look into more before having a full opinion on it [(Wojniusz et al., 2016;](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01053/full)  [Hayes, 2017;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5253377/)  [Schneider et al., 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29184488/).

### Detransition and Regret

**Detransition and regret following a gender transition are related but distinct concepts. However, they are often studied alongside each other. Instances of regret and detransition following sex reassignment surgery exist, but research has generally found it to be very rare. Data varies, but the vast majority of research identified in reviewing the literature as well as meta-analysis suggests that the rates of either are less than 5%.**

[Regret after Gender-affirmation Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Prevalence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099405/)

- Meta-analysis of 27 studies
- Finds that there is an extremely low prevalence of regret in transgender patients after gender-affirmation surgeries (<1% for trans-masculine and 1% for trans-feminine).

[Detransition rates in a national UK Gender Identity Clinic](https://epath.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Boof-of-abstracts-EPATH2019.pdf#page=139)

- _“Patient assessment reports created between August 1st 2016 to August 1st 2017 were scanned electronically for words related to detransition or regret.”_
- _“Of the 3398 patients who had appointments during this period, 16 (0.47%) expressed transition-related regret or detransitioned.”_

[Abstract: A Survey Study of Surgeons’ Experience with Regret and/or Reversal of Gender-Confirmation Surgeries](https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/Fulltext/2018/08001/Abstract__A_Survey_Study_of_Surgeons__Experience.266.aspx)

- _“46 surgeons (30%) responded to the survery. 67% of providers have been in practice for greater than 10 years and most surgeons practice in the United States (69%) followed by Europe (22%). Surgeons were asked to select a range representing the number of transgender patients they have surgically treated, and this amounted to a cumulative number of approximately 22,725 patients treated by the cohort. 49% of respondents had never encountered a patient who regretted their gender transition or were seeking detransition care. 12 providers encountered 1 patient with regret and the rest encountered more than one patient. This amounted to a total of 62 patients. There were 13 patients who regretted chest surgery and 45 patients who regretted genital surgery.”_

[Factors Associated with Satisfaction or Regret Following Male-to-Female Sex Reassignment Surgery](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364#page-1)

- _"Participants, all of whom were at least 1-year postoperative, completed a written questionnaire concerning their experiences and attitudes. Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives. None reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret.”_

[The Amsterdam Cohort of Gender Dysphoria Study (1972-2015): Trends in Prevalence, Treatment, and Regrets](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463477/)

- _"Only 0.6% of transwomen and 0.3% of transmen who underwent gonadectomy were identified as experiencing regret."_

[An analysis of all applications for sex reassignment surgery in Sweden, 1960-2010: prevalence, incidence, and regrets](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24872188/)

- _“Incidence and prevalence of applications in Sweden for legal and surgical sex reassignment were examined over a 50-year period (1960-2010), including the legal and surgical reversal applications.”_
- _“There were 15 (5 MF and 10 MF) regret applications corresponding to a 2.2% regret rate for both sexes. There was a significant decline of regrets over the time period.”_

[What does the scholarly research say about the effect of gender transition on transgender well-being?](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/)

- _“Regrets following gender transition are extremely rare and have become even rarer as both surgical techniques and social support have improved. Pooling data from numerous studies demonstrates a regret rate ranging from .3 percent to 3.8 percent. Regrets are most likely to result from a lack of social support after transition or poor surgical outcomes using older techniques.”_

[Factors Leading to “Detransition” Among Transgender and Gender Diverse People in the United States: A Mixed-Methods Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213007/)

- _“A total of 17,151 (61.9%) participants reported that they had ever pursued gender affirmation, broadly defined. Of these, 2242 (13.1%) reported a history of detransition. Of those who had detransitioned, 82.5% reported at least one external driving factor.”_
- _“Respondents were asked the following question, “Have you ever de-transitioned? In other words, have you ever gone back to living as your sex assigned at birth, at least for a while?” with the following response options: “Yes,” “No,” and “I have never transitioned.”_
- **I wonder if this study has such a high detransition rate because it asks if a person has ever gone back at least for a while to living as your sex assigned at birth. It’s possible that many people who answered this question simply did a temporary detransitioning as opposed to anything permanent, and this would explain the discrepancy between this result and others.**

[Access to care and frequency of detransition among a cohort discharged by a UK national adult gender identity clinic: retrospective case-note review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8503911/)

- _“A retrospective case-note review was performed as a service evaluation for 175 service users consecutively discharged by a tertiary National Health Service adult GIC between 1 September 2017 and 31 August 2018.”_
- _“Twelve people (6.9%) met our case definition of detransitioning.”_
- **This is the second individual study which disagrees with the provided 5% or less number I suggested. I suspect this is due to a relatively low sample size to estimate the prevalence of what is a rare phenomenon. It’s thus fair to suggest that the result is due to statistical noise over anything.**

**It should be noted that there are a variety of factors which explain why regret or detransition occurs, some of which are arguably not due to the surgery itself. For example, the factor most consistently reported in the literature is social stigma. Still, other reasons which appear inherent to the surgery include complications, a lack of a sex life (which can be a consequence of complications), treatment interruptions, individuals changing their mind about their gender identity (which cannot always be predicted), and not belonging to the core group of transsexuals (which is irrelevant to the issue of transgenderism).**

[Detransition rates in a national UK Gender Identity Clinic](https://epath.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Boof-of-abstracts-EPATH2019.pdf#page=139)

- _“The reasons stated by patients for their regret or detransition included: social factors, reporting physical complications, and changing their mind about their gender identity and identifying as their gender assigned at birth.”_

[Factors Associated with Satisfaction or Regret Following Male-to-Female Sex Reassignment Surgery](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364#page-1)

- _“Dissatisfaction was most strongly associated with unsatisfactory physical and functional results of surgery."_

[Factors Leading to “Detransition” Among Transgender and Gender Diverse People in the United States: A Mixed-Methods Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213007/)

- _“Frequently endorsed external factors included pressure from family and societal stigma. History of detransition was associated with male sex assigned at birth, nonbinary gender identity, bisexual sexual orientation, and having a family unsupportive of one's gender identity. A total of 15.9% of respondents reported at least one internal driving factor, including fluctuations in or uncertainty regarding gender identity."_

[Postoperative regrets after sex reassignment surgery: A case report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1158136012001120?via%3Dihub)

- _“The scientific literature shows that the risk of regret is higher among men who have experienced a long heterosexual life, whose request for sex reassignment comes late in life, and who do not receive the support of family and friends. To this conclusion, we might add that the lack of sex life, interruption of the treatment and the absence of gender disorder in childhood seem to be significant criteria for risk of postoperative regret.”_

[Factors predictive of regret in sex reassignment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9570489/)

- Looks at factors predictive of regret in sex reassignment
- Finds that the 2 predictors were belonging to the non-core group of transsexuals and lack of support from the patient’s family.

_Further Information:_

[Detransition-Related Needs and Support: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2021.1919479)

Regret rates for surgery are extremely low [(Wiepjes et al., 2018)](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(18)30057-2/fulltext). Dissatisfaction, while rare, is most strongly associated with unsatisfactory physical and functional results of surgery [(Lawrence, 2003)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364). Of those who detransition, evidence suggests that the majority of time it is due to at least one external driving factor, such as pressure from family and societal stigma. A minority report that it is due to at least one internal driving factor, including fluctuations in or uncertainty regarding gender identity [(Turban et al., 2021)](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/lgbt.2020.0437).

### Fertility

Puberty blockers do not cause infertility although may pause the development of things which affect fertility potential [(Cheng et al., 2019;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31380227/)  [The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health, 2021)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00139-5/fulltext). Hormone therapy can affect fertility, although this is potentially reversible. Gender-affirming surgery that involves hysterectomy and oophorectomy in transmen or orchiectomy in transwomen results in permanent sterility [(Cheng et al., 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31380227/).

## Well-Being

### Mental Health

**Transgender people have poor mental health relative to the general population. Discrimination appears to be a major predictor in negatively affecting mental health.**

[Discriminatory experiences associated with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms among transgender adults](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26866637/)

- _“the 5 most frequently reported reasons for discrimination were: gender identity and/or expression (83%), masculine and feminine appearance (79%), sexual orientation (68%), sex (57%), and age (44%). Higher everyday discrimination scores (β = 0.25; 95% CL [0.21, 0.30]) and greater number of attributed reasons for discrimination experiences (β = 0.05; 95% CL [0.01, 0.10]) were independently associated with PTSD symptoms, even after adjusting for prior trauma experiences.”_

[Substance Use to Cope with Stigma in Healthcare Among U.S. Female-to-Male Trans Masculine Adults](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808281/)

- _“Overall, 14.1% of the sample reported having been refused care by a provider (enacted stigma), 32.8% reported delaying needed medical care when sick/injured, and 39.1% delayed routine preventive care (anticipated stigma). Having been refused care was significantly associated with avoidance of healthcare, including delaying needed medical care when sick/injured and delaying routine preventive medical care. Substance use to cope with mistreatment was self-reported by 27.6% of the sample. Enacted stigma by providers was associated with self-reported substance use to cope. Delays in both needed and preventive care (anticipated stigma) were highly associated with substance use, and attenuated the effect of enacted stigma.”_

[High Burden of Mental Health Problems, Substance Use, Violence, and Related Psychosocial Factors in Transgender, Non-Binary, and Gender Diverse Youth and Young Adults](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7018588/)

- _“Among TGD [transgender and gender diverse] youth, we found high rates of depression and suicidality (ideation, plan, attempt), violence (trauma, victimization, childhood sexual abuse), and substance use (cigarette, alcohol, illicit drug use). With the exception of depression, transgender women and non-binary AMAB youth reported worse health outcomes than transgender men and non-binary AFAB youth. Non-binary AMAB youth reported the highest rates of certain outcomes, including traumatic experiences and suicidal ideation. TGD youth generally reported worse outcomes than cisgender sexual minority youth; these differences were less pronounced among AFAB youth.”_

[The mental health of Canadian transgender youth compared with the Canadian population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5630273/)

- _“Transgender youth had a higher risk of reporting psychological distress, self-harm, major depressive episode, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Risk ratios ranged from 3.8 to 16.1. Transgender boys/men and non-binary youth were most likely to report self-harm and non-binary youth also reported lower overall mental health.”_

[Psychiatric disorders in individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria: A systematic review](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pcn.12947)

-   Systematic review

-   Psychiatric disorders are very common amongst individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use/abuse disorders.

[Mothers of boys with gender identity disorder: a comparison of matched controls](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2016237/)

-   Compares mothers of boys with gender identity disorder with mothers of normal boys

-   Finds that mothers of boys with GID had more symptoms of depression and more often met the criteria for borderline personality disorder than the controls.

-   Systematic review and meta-analysis

-   LGBTQ+ young people had particularly high levels of victimization and mental health difficulties within LGBTQ+ young people with experiences of self-harm or suicide, compared to cisgender, heterosexual counterparts who also had these experiences.

[Eating Disorder Diagnoses and Symptom Presentation in Transgender Youth: a Scoping Review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336571721_Eating_Disorder_Diagnoses_and_Symptom_Presentation_in_Transgender_Youth_a_Scoping_Review)

-   Literature review

-   Significantly higher rates of eating disorder symptoms were documented in trans youth compared to cis youth

### Suicide

**There is increased suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender people. Notable risk factors include psychological distress, substance abuse, discrimination, familial rejection, conversion therapy, and physical abuse. Notable protective factors include supportive families, hormone therapy and/or surgical care, and living in a state with gender identity nondiscrimination laws.**

[Suicide in trans populations: A systematic review of prevalence and correlates](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31802-001)

- Systematic review of 30 articles
- Finds that discrimination increased suicidal ideation and attempts attempts of transgender people, while positive social interactions and timely access to interventions had positive effects.
- However, results clearly indicated a need to improve on individual and structural levels.

[SUICIDE THOUGHTS AND ATTEMPTS AMONG TRANSGENDER ADULTS Findings from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Suicidality-Transgender-Sep-2019.pdf)

- Finds that general suicidality risk factors for transgender adults are psychological distress, alcohol or illicit drug use (excluding marijuana), and poor general health.
- Unique suicidality risk factors include discrimination, familial rejection, conversion therapy, religious community rejection, experiences of violence, detransitioning, those who are not viewed as transgender (lower), those who do not disclose to others that they are transgender (lower), and minority stress.
- Supportive families, hormone therapy and/or surgical care, and living in a state with gender identity nondiscrimination laws all reduced suicide.

[Attempted suicide among transgender persons: The influence of gender-based discrimination and victimization](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17135115/)

- _“increasing societal acceptance of the transgender community and decreasing gender-based prejudice may help prevent suicide in this highly stigmatized population.”_

[Predictors of Suicidal Ideation in a Statewide Sample of Transgender Individuals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4713016/pdf/lgbt.2013.0048.pdf)

- _“Violence, discrimination, and transition status significantly predicted SI. Compared with individuals with no plans to transition, individuals with plans or who were living as their identified gender reported greater odds of lifetime SI”_

[Physical victimization, gender identity and suicide risk among transgender men and women](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335516300882)

- _“Trans men and women experience high levels of physical abuse and face multiple forms of discrimination. They are also at an increased risk for suicidal tendencies. Interventions that help transindividuals cope with discrimination and physical victimization simultaneously may be more effective in saving lives._

### Social Support

**Social support of transgender people from friends and family, as well as self-acceptance, positively predicts quality of life along a variety of metrics.**

[Perceived Discrimination, Social Support, and Quality of Life in Gender Dysphoria](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1743609516301734)

- Study of 94 trans men
- Finds that social support from friends and family positively predicts quality of life, while perceived group discrimination had no effect on quality of life.

- Literature review of 42 studies
- Finds that family acceptance in general is linked to positive well-being of LGBT youth, and that accepting behavior of their orientation or identity is also linked to positive well-being.

[Chosen Name Use Is Linked to Reduced Depressive Symptoms, Suicidal Ideation, and Suicidal Behavior Among Transgender Youth](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(18)30085-5/fulltext#intraref0010a)

- Study of 129 transgender youths
- Finds that after adjusting for personal characteristics and social support, chosen name use in more contexts was associated with lower depression, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior.

- _“Among trans Ontarians, 35.1 % (95 % CI: 27.6, 42.5) seriously considered, and 11.2 % (95 % CI: 6.0, 16.4) attempted, suicide in the past year. Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal identification documents changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions in suicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries (when needed). Parental support for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation. Lower self-reported transphobia (10th versus 90th percentile) was associated with a 66 % reduction in ideation (RR = 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.67), and an additional 76 % reduction in attempts among those with ideation (RR = 0.24; 95 % CI: 0.07, 0.82). This corresponds to potential prevention of 160 ideations per 1000 trans persons, and 200 attempts per 1,000 with ideation, based on a hypothetical reduction of transphobia from current levels to the 10th percentile.”_

- _"In general, depressive symptoms, suicidality, interpersonal trauma exposure, substance use disorders, anxiety, and general distress have been consistently elevated among TGNC adults."_
- _“Findings suggest that TGNC people are exposed to a variety of social stressors, including stigma, discrimination, and bias events that contribute to mental health problems. Social support, community connectedness, and effective coping strategies appear beneficial.”_

### Discrimination

In general, transgender people report facing a lot of discrimination in many areas of life and also don't feel comfortable in many areas [(Whittle et al., 2007;](http://www.pfc.org.uk/pdf/EngenderedPenalties.pdf)  [Bradford et al., 2013;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3780721/) [Herman et al., 2016)](https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf). Those who have been discriminated against more or victimized more had poorer mental health [(Bockting et al., 2013;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3698807/)  [Mustanski et al., 2016;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815715/)  [Wilson et al., 2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5025345/), even when just looking at a population with low-income and of a specific ethnicity [(Bazargan & Galvan, 2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3497862/). A survey of college students found that treatment-seeking and non-treatment-seeking transgender college students did not significantly differ with regard to psychological distress or experiences of victimization, including suicide attempts and self-injury, with the exception of rates of suicidal ideation in which treatment-seeking transgender students reported higher [(Effrig et al., 2011)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2161-1882.2011.tb00269.x).

Transgender people tend to have poor healthcare experiences [(Howard et al., 2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6816758/), with one study reporting that 19% of transgender/gender-nonconforming individuals say they have been refused medical care based on their transgender/gender-nonconforming identity [(Kattari et al., 2015)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15532739.2015.1064336?journalCode=wijt20). Higher reported stigma is associated with lower utilization of health services for transgender and non-binary people [(Whitehead et al., 2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4701471/). Generally speaking, primary care providers have positive attitudes toward LGBTQ people, but a minority have negative attitudes [(Aleshire et al., 2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1524839918778835). This suggests that negative healthcare experiences are primarily due to a minority of healthcare providers as opposed to being due to wide numbers of healthcare providers exhibiting bias.

LGBT people report high rates of workplace harassment and employment discrimination [(Sears & Mallory, 2011)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/03m1g5sg).. [Schilt & Wiswall (2008)](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.2202/1935-1682.1862/html) found that while transgender people have the same human capital after their transitions, their workplace experiences often change radically. Average earnings for female-to-male transgender workers increase slightly following their gender transitions, while average earnings for male-to-female transgender workers fall by nearly ⅓.

School harassment due to transgender identity is pervasive, and harassment is negatively associated with feelings of safety. When schools took action to reduce harassment, students reported greater connections to school personnel, increasing feelings of safety [(McGuire et al., 2010)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-010-9540-7). Transgender youth perceived as more gender incongruent had higher odds of bullying victimization and emotional distress relative to those perceived as very congruent with their biological sex [(Gower et al., 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6034394/). LGBT youth who attended a high school with a gay-straight alliance (GSA) report significantly more favorable outcomes related to school experiences, alcohol use, and psychological distress [(Heck et al., 2013)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F2329-0382.1.S.81).

While transgender people do not appear to be at a higher risk of homicide than cisgender people (Dinno, 2017; Stotzer, 2017), transgender people are disproportionately likely to experience violent incidents (Lombardi et al., 2008; Flores et al., 2021), with a particularly high risk of experiencing sexual violence and intimate partner violence (Stotzer, 2009; Peitzmeier et al., 2020).

Transgender people report a high amount of discrimination in public accommodations, with one study reporting that 65% of transgender people reported public accommodations discrimination in the past 12 months [(Reisner et al., 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26219197/).

Much of the public eye surrounding transgender people examines transgender women in particular, and thus trans women receive the overwhelming majority of societal fascination, consternation, and demonization. This is theorized to be due to what is called "trans-misogyny", which is steeped in the assumption that femaleness and femininity are inferior to, and exist primarily for the benefit of, maleness and masculinity [(Serano, 2007)](https://www.juliaserano.com/av/TransmisogynyPrimer-Serano.pdf).

### Bullying

Transgender youth are more likely to be bullied and to perpetuate bullying. However, transgender identities are more strongly associated with perpetration of bullying than subjection to bullying [(Heino et al., 2021)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.612424/full#h4).

### Disease

A large proportion of MTFs engage in risky sexual behaviors and have high rates of HIV infection. Prevalence rates of HIV and risk behaviors are low among FTMs [(Herbst et al., 2008)](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/571708). Interestingly however, there is a positive correlation between exposure to transphobia and HIV risk behavior [(Sugano et al., 2006)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-005-9040-z). It is difficult to suggest how the causality operates in this relation but it is an interesting correlation nonetheless.

## Gender Dysphoria

### Epidemiology

Estimates about the prevalence of a transgender identity range from 0.5-1.5%, depending on the study and age group [(Collin et al., 2017;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4823815/)  [Zucker, 2017;](https://www.publish.csiro.au/sh/SH17067)  [Herman et al., 2022)](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/age-trans-individuals-us/). Among US adults, about 0.5% identify as transgender, compared to about 1.4% among youth ages 13-17 [(Herman et al., 2022)](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/age-trans-individuals-us/).

Around 11% of transgender people have autism spectrum disorder [(Warrier et al., 2020;](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17794-1)  [Kallitsounaki & Williams, 2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-022-05517-y). Schizophrenia also occurs in patients with gender dysphoria at higher rates than the general population, likely due to neurological links shared between the two [(Rajkumar, 2014)](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/schizort/2014/463757/).

### Neurology

The brains of transgender people exhibit features resembling those of their experienced gender [(Guillamon et al., 2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987404/), despite the majority of features resembling those from their natal sex [(Frigerio et al., 2018)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-021-02005-9.pdf). However, there is a high correlation between transgenderism and homosexuality, which makes it difficult to entable correlates of sexual orientation and gender identity [(Smith et al., 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763415002432). After controlling for sexual orientation, transgender people had relatively similar brain structures for the exception of parts that mediate their own body perception [(Burke et al., 2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17352-8.pdf).

This is consistent with research suggesting that while there is a genetic role for the development of gender identity disorders [(Heylens et al., 2011;](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)33906-0/fulltext)  [Diamond, 2013)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15532739.2013.750222) , transgenderism does not seem to be associated with any molecular mutations of some of the main genes involved in sexual differentiation [(Lombardo et al., 2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23324476/).

This is also consistent with evidence suggesting that prenatal hormone exposure, while having an effect on sex-typed activity interests and engagement, as well as spatial abilities, has no major effect on gender identity or sexual orientation [(Hines, 2006;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17074984/)  [Berenbaum & Beltz, 2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4681519/).

### Early Development

While I will not comment on the desistance debate as from what I've seen there's a lot of conflicting evidence on it and the issue is relatively unimportant to me, children referred for gender dysphoria have high levels of suicidality [(Aitken & Vanderlaan, 2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300420411_Self-Harm_and_Suicidality_in_Children_Referred_for_Gender_Dysphoria). Children with persistent gender dysphoria have gender dysphoria to a much more extreme extent, suggesting that there may be some predictability to who desists and who does not [(Wallien & Cohen-Kettenis, 2008;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18981931/)  [Steensma et al., 2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23702447/), irrespective of the actual desistance rate.

### Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria

**Rapid onset gender dysphoria (ROGD) is essentially a hypothesized diagnosis for a portion of teen or young adult children who rapidly become gender dysphoric due to social influence or “social contagion” affecting youth vulnerable to mental disorders/illness. It should be noted that this was an emerging hypothesis derived from surveys of parents of gender dysphoric children, as opposed to being an analysis done by actual psychiatrists interviewing such gender dysphoric children. This at the very least raises questions about the legitimacy of ROGD as a medical category.**

[Parent reports of adolescents and young adults perceived to show signs of a rapid onset of gender dysphoria](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

- Surveys parents from websites where parents reported sudden or rapid onsets of gender dysphoria occurring in their teen or young adult children.
- Suggests the possibility of a new category of gender dysphoria, called “rapid onset gender dysphoria”

[Correction: Parent reports of adolescents and young adults perceived to show signs of a rapid onset of gender dysphoria](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214157)

- Correction and clarification of the above study
- Notes that Rapid onset gender dysphoria is not a formal diagnosis, and that the parent report sample results in bias.

**There has been testing done to see if there is a relationship between recency of belief regarding one’s gender and mental health problems. If the ROGD hypothesis was true, people who had a higher recency of belief would likely be those who had more susceptibility to mental problems. However, research has suggested that if anything, the opposite is the case, suggesting that ROGD is not a real thing or only affects a very small proportion of gender dysphoric individuals.**

[Do Clinical Data from Transgender Adolescents Support the Phenomenon of “Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria”?](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)01085-4/fulltext)

- Tests the hypothesis of rapid onset gender dysphoria
- _“In 2018, a phenomenon of rapid onset gender dysphoria was hypothesized as a distinct pathway involving social contagion among youth vulnerable due to mental or neurodevelopmental disorders, raising public concerns regarding potential for later regret following gender-affirming medical care.”_
- _“If the rapid onset gender dysphoria hypothesis indeed characterizes a distinct clinical phenomenon, and these youth access referrals for hormone suppression or gender-affirming hormones, then we would expect to see differentiation within clinical samples between those with more-recent (ie, rapid-onset) vs more-remote knowledge regarding their gender. Based on the published hypothesis, we would expect more recent gender knowledge to be associated with self-reported mental health measures, mental health and neurodevelopmental disability diagnoses, behaviors consistent with maladaptive coping (eg, self-harm), support from online and/or transgender friends but not parents, and lesser gender dysphoria.”_
- _“Controlling for age and sex assigned at birth, recent gender knowledge was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms, psychological distress, past diagnoses with mental health issues or neurodevelopmental disorders, gender dysphoria symptoms, self-harm, past-year suicide attempt, having gender-supportive online friends, general support from online friends or transgender friends, or gender support from parents. Recent gender knowledge was associated with lower scores on anxiety severity/impairment (b = −3.272; 95% CI −5.172, −1.373), and lower prevalence of marijuana use (prevalence ratio = 0.11; 95% CI 0.02, 0.82), counter to hypothesized directions of effect. For sensitivity analysis using the alternate (value ≤2) definition of recent gender knowledge, we found all results substantively the same in statistical significance and direction of effect, except past-year marijuana use, which now only approached statistical significance (P = .0677).”_

[Rapid-onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults: A study of parental reports](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327065646_Rapid-onset_gender_dysphoria_in_adolescents_and_young_adults_A_study_of_parental_reports)

-   The adolescent and young adult (AYA) children described were predominantly female sex at birth (82.8%) with a mean age of 16.4 years. Forty-one percent of the AYAs had expressed a non-heterosexual sexual orientation before identifying as transgender. 

-   Many (62.5%) of the AYAs had been diagnosed with at least one mental health disorder or neurodevelopmental disability prior to the onset of their gender dysphoria (range of the number of pre-existing diagnoses 0--7). In 36.8% of the friendship groups described, the majority of the members became transgender-identified. 

-   The most likely outcomes were that AYA mental well-being and parent-child relationships became worse since AYAs "came out". 

-   AYAs expressed a range of behaviors that included: expressing distrust of non-transgender people (22.7%); stopping spending time with non-transgender friends (25.0%); trying to isolate themselves from their families (49.4%), and only trusting information about gender dysphoria from transgender sources (46.6%). 

-   Conclusion Rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD) describes a phenomenon where the development of gender dysphoria is observed to begin suddenly during or after puberty in an adolescent or young adult who would not have met criteria for gender dysphoria in childhood.

### Alternative Treatments

To my knowledge, research attempting to use alternative ways to treat gender dysphoria is extremely lacking. There is one case study documenting a successful treatment of gender dysphoria using pimozide [(Puri & Singh, 1996)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8839957/). [Turban et al. (2019)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2749479) found that there was an association between recalled exposure to gender identity conversion efforts and poor mental health outcomes. However, the study was rife with problems, including poor sampling, a poor definition of conversion therapy which doesn't distinguish between clearly unethical interventions and potentially good-faith interventions, a poor mental health metric, and lack of control for pre-conversion effort mental health status [(D'Angelo et al., 2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-020-01844-2?fbclid=IwAR3BcUzgtjluKa01-PBIMAMIbTVUzpbWJ9pEbLpVEol2eIZ3bpAmjFR6Yyo). Thus, there is no significant evidence suggesting alternative ways to treat gender dysphoria are ineffective. Given that there are significant personal, social, and physical effects of existing gender dysphoria treatments more research should be done in this area to help figure out how to best treat gender dysphoria.

## Public Affairs

### Public Accomodations

**Transgender people appear to fare better in terms of mental health when there are public accommodations for them, such as inclusive bathroom policies and inclusive housing. This comes with no clear negative impacts. Sexual assaults do not appear to occur at higher rates when there are inclusive bathroom policies. Funnily enough, it is men who are the most concerned about transgender-inclusive bathroom policies, in spite of the fact that they don’t have to experience the issues they fear women will, of “trans women predators”.**

**Transgender teens with restricted bathroom access are at higher risk of sexual assault than the population average. This makes perfect sense if having two genders in a washroom meant traditionally for one creates social conditions which lead to sexual assaults occurring.**

[Transgender teens with restricted bathroom access at higher risk of sexual assault](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/transgender-teens-restricted-bathroom-access-sexual-assault/)

- Survey of nearly 3700 teens aged 13-17
- Finds that 36% of transgender or non-binary students with restricted bathroom or locker room access reported being sexually assaulted in the past year, compared to the population average of 25.9%.

**Denial of access to gender-appropriate college housing or bathrooms is positively associated with suicidality for transgender individuals.**

[Transgender Adults’ Access to College Bathrooms and Housing and the Relationship to Suicidality](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2016.1157998)

- Surveys 2316 transgender people
- Finds that denial of access to gender-appropriate college housing or bathrooms is positively associated with suicidality.

**Unfortunately, transender people still appear to suffer from problems in their gender-appropriate restrooms, with denial of access, verbal harassment, and physical assault not being uncommon for transgender people to experience.**

[Gendered Restrooms and Minority Stress](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/gendered-restrooms-minority-stress/)

- *“Many respondents reported experiencing problems in public restrooms, including being denied access, verbally harassed, or physically assaulted.”*

**Most research suggests that allowing transgender people into the gender-appropriate washroom does not cause increases in incidents of privacy and safety violations in such spaces.**

[Gender Identity Nondiscrimination Laws in Public Accommodations: a Review of Evidence Regarding Safety and Privacy in Public Restrooms, Locker Rooms, and Changing Rooms](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-018-0335-z)

- Analyses localities of Massachusetts with and without gender-inclusive bathroom bills
- Finds that the bills are not related to the number or frequency of criminal incidents in these places
- Moreover, reports of privacy and safety violations in public restrooms are exceedingly rare

[School Restroom and Locker Room Restrictions and Sexual Assault Risk Among Transgender Youth](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/143/6/e20182902/76816/School-Restroom-and-Locker-Room-Restrictions-and)

- *“The 12-month prevalence of sexual assault was 26.5% among transgender boys, 27.0% among nonbinary youth assigned female at birth, 18.5% among transgender girls, and 17.6% among nonbinary youth assigned male at birth. Youth whose restroom and locker room use was restricted were more likely to experience sexual assault compared with those without restrictions, with risk ratios of 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02–1.52) in transgender boys, 1.42 (95% CI: 1.10–1.78) in nonbinary youth assigned female at birth, and 2.49 (95% CI: 1.11–4.28) in transgender girls. Restrictions were not associated with sexual assault among nonbinary youth assigned male at birth.”*

**I did locate one study which suggested otherwise. However, this study looked at media reports as opposed to statistics and self-reporting data. Therefore, it is necessarily biased towards media which may paint transgender people in a more or less fair light than in reality and may exaggerate implicitly the actual incidence of sexual assault in such washrooms.**

[Gender-Inclusion Policies and Sexual Violence: A Longitudinal Analysis of Media Reports at Target Stores](https://womanmeanssomething.com/targetstudy/)

- *“Using Target stores as a case study, we analyzed 220 media-reported sexual offenses in Target stores from 2003 to August of 2017 to determine the association, if any, between their gender-identity access policy made public in April 2016 and reported sexual offenses in their stores.”*
- *“Sexual incidents increased over the course of the entire timeframe of the media reports. In particular, voyeurism-related offenses (Upskirt and Peeping Tom) increased significantly after the publication of Target’s gender-inclusion policy in April, 2016. The three-season forced-category measurement found a 2.3x increase in the amount of upskirt incidents after the policy, and a 2.9x increase in peeping tom incidents after the policy. In a Poisson regression, using trimesters to control for seasonal variations in offenses, the fold change in rate from the four year pre-policy period to the post-policy period was 3.03 for Upskirt and 3.14 for Peeping Tom. Using a two year pre-policy period, the rate change was 2.16 times for Upskirt and 2.34 times for Peeping Tom.”*

**The lack of a positive relationship between inclusive bathroom policy and safety and privacy violations might partially help explain why men are more concerned about transgender women in female bathrooms than women are, despite not being the demographic who is experiencing the issues they care about. This could be seen as a sort of sexist condescension or a lack of understanding of the actual effects of allowing transgender women into female washrooms. Regardless, it is fairly ironic.**

[Which Gender is More Concerned About Transgender Women in Female Bathrooms?](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12147-016-9181-6)

- *“We enumerate 1035 user comments from 190 online articles to gauge public opinion about safety and privacy when transgender women use female bathrooms. In these comments, we find that cisgender males are around 1.55× as likely to express concern about safety and privacy as cisgender females. Moreover, we find that when expressing concern (a) cisgender females are around 4× as likely as cisgender males to assert that transgender women do not directly cause their safety and privacy concerns, typically emphasizing their concerns are about ‘perverts’ posing as transgender females, and (b) cisgender males are around 1.5× as likely as cisgender females to assert that transgender females directly cause their safety and privacy concerns. We theorize that the heightened concern seen in males in these comments stems from them being more likely to view transgender females not as females, but as males who are lying or mistaken about their gender, and consequently they view themselves as protecting females from these males intruding into private, female-only spaces. This may be further exacerbated by a fear of deception and a belief that transgender people are mentally ill or ‘sick’.”*

[Unisex changing rooms put women at danger of sexual assault, data reveals](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/sexual-assault-unisex-changing-rooms-sunday-times-women-risk-a8519086.html)

-   The vast majority of reported sexual assaults at public swimming pools in the UK take place in unisex changing rooms.

-   Just under 90% of complaints involving sexual assaults, voyeurism, and harassment happen in such changing rooms

-   This is despite the fact that unisex changing rooms account for less than half of the changing areas across the UK

["I don't think you belong in here:" The impact of gender segregated bathrooms on the safety, health, and equality of transgender people](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10538720.2021.1920539?casa_token=PJ5o_PQaO-QAAAAA:WODf1JE9IuUljZvWJ4kPgYIsysqzB2AVfH87bahVq_eNGywOdwTY7vLb3L12Q_2obei3yAX6HrUY)

Transgender youth experience barriers to bathroom access that can contribute to negative mental health outcomes, impede educational functioning, and threaten physical safety. Recommendations are made for gender inclusive designs that diminish the isolation of genderneutral designs and preempt the backlash inherent in existing gender segregated practices. Gender inclusive bathrooms, in addition to the benefits to transgender people, could also contribute to better quality of life for parents of small children, people with disabilities and their caregivers, and other marginalized individuals.

### Military

**Allowing transgender people in the military would allow for a larger military with no negative effects on the effectiveness of such a military force. Moreover, gender-affirming therapy in the military would constitute minimal expenditures and would improve the ability for transgender people to participate effectively in the military. There is generally support for transgender people to serve openly in the military amongst military personnel, at least in the United States, although the military nonetheless appears to be less tolerant than the general population of transgender people, due to political ideology and religious affiliation differences.**

[Assessing the Implications of Allowing Transgender Personnel to Serve Openly](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1530.html)

- Finds that in the US, the costs of gender transition-related healthcare treatment would represent a 0.04-0.13% increase in active-component healthcare expenditures
- Using US and foreign data, they also find that allowing women and LGBT people into the military has no effects on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness.
- Allowing transgender people into the military in foreign countries has actually been beneficial to all service members through creating a more diverse and inclusive force.

[Gender Identity in the Canadian Forces: A Review of Possible Impacts on Operational Effectiveness](https://www.palmcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Transgender-Military-Service-in-Canada.pdf)

- *“our finding is that despite ongoing prejudice and incomplete policy formulation and implementation, allowing transgender personnel to serve openly has not harmed the CF’s effectiveness.”*

[Support for Transgender Military Service from Active Duty United States Military Personnel](https://dworakpeck.usc.edu/sites/default/files/2020-10/Dunlap%20Holloway%20Pickering%20et%20al.pdf)

- *“Findings indicate broad support for transgender military service across all four branches of the military and military ranks, with some statistically significant differences in support emerging by gender, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity.”*

[Cadet and Civilian Undergraduate Attitudes toward Transgender People: A Research Note](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095327X15575278)

- *“Further analyses shows that the impact of military affiliation is reduced substantially by controlling for background characteristics, especially political ideology and religious affiliation.”*

[Military Sexual Assault in Transgender Veterans: Results From a Nationwide Survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6709681/)

-   17.2% of transgender veterans experienced military sexual assault. This varies between transgender women (15.2%) and transgender men (30.0%).

### Sports

There are many sports organizations which allow transgender women to compete in the female category, but have certain restrictions with the intent of ensuring fairness. For example, the International Olympic Committee requires total serum testosterone levels to be suppressed below 10 nmol/L for at least 12 months prior to and during competition [(IOC, 2015)](https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/2015-11_ioc_consensus_meeting_on_sex_reassignment_and_hyperandrogenism-en.pdf). While these policies can be argued to be attempts at being more inclusive towards transgender people, a population which reports generally feeling excluded from sports [(Hargie et al., 2015)](https://web.archive.org/web/20180719224455/https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/38576/6/Transgender%20paper.pdf), research suggests that they likely inhibit the fairness of many sports overall:

-   **Anthropometric Factors** - Height and skeletal parameters remain virtually unaltered in transgender women, which can confer sporting advantages in sports where height is an advantage [(Hilton & Lundberg, 2020)](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0226/v1).

-  **Muscle Mass** - Longitudinal data shows a clear pattern of very modest to negligible changes in muscle mass and strength in transgender women suppressing testosterone for at least 12 months [(Hilton & Lundberg, 2020)](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0226/v1).

-   **Endurance-Based Performance** - Weak cross-sectional evidence suggests that endurance-based performance differences reduce roughly to parity following testosterone suppression [(Hilton & Lundberg, 2020)](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0226/v1).

-   **Hemoglobin** - Hemoglobin level disparities are eliminated following hormone therapy [(Harper et al., 2020)](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/15/865)..

Thus, transgender women in many metrics, but not all, are physically superior to cisgender women, making their inclusion into women's sports in many cases unfair. However, it should be noted that none of this research is looking at elite-level comparisons between transgender and cisgender women, which may affect the relative differences. Moreover, there may be some sports such as endurance sports where transgender women do not exhibit any significant advantages to cisgender women. There needs to be a more rigorous examination of these issues if we wish to balance the fairness of elite sports with the desires of transgender women to feel included.

I'm therefore against transgender women being allowed to compete in many elite-level sports where they may have an unfair advantage. This however wouldn't extend to lower-level sports which are more casual and in which the stakes are less severe, such as high school sports. In those cases, I don't see a significant issue with letting transgender women compete in the women's category in spite of risks of an unfair competitive advantage.

SIDENOTE: [(Jones et al., 2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/) is sometimes cited as a literature review suggesting that transgender male or female individuals do not have an athletic advantage at any stage of their transition, but the authors later clarified in [Jones et al (2020)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01324-6) that the paper suggested that there wasn't direct evidence at the time that would support the IOC policy or other sporting organizational policies. Rather than the paper being for transgender female inclusion into women's sports, it is agnostic to the question.

### Prisons

Data suggests that transgender women in male prisons are greatly disproportionately sexually abused compared to non-transgender inmates in men's prisons [(Just Detention International, 2013)](https://justdetention.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FS-Targets-For-Abuse-Transgender-Inmates-And-Prisoner-Rape.pdf). At the same time, data from England and Wales suggests that nearly half of transgender prisoners have been convicted for sexual offenses, compared to 19% of males and 4% of females in the overall prison population [(Biggs, 2020)](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/43f2t/). This lends credence to the hypothesis that there may be male inmates who insincerely attempt to identify as transgender to enter women's spaces where they can engage in predatory behavior. Thus there is a very difficult dilemma posed. If however, we do hold that we should try and ensure that sincere transgender women do enter women's prisons where they'll be safe from sexual assault, we must take great care in rooting out false positives as not doing so could have disastrous consequences.

### Perception

Negative media depictions of transgender people is significantly associated with clinically significant symptoms of depression [(Hughto et al., 2021)](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/lgbt.2020.0279). Transgender narratives can also influence viewers of any political ideology, including conservative, to be positive towards transgender individuals [(Gillig et al., 2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-017-0816-1). Thus, media has an important role to play in the issue of transgenderism.
