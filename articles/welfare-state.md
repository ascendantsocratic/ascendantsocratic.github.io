The effects of an expanded welfare state, usually measured in the form of social spending, have been studied extensively:

- **Crime -** higher expenditures on a variety of different social programs have all been associated with significant drops in crime [(Hannon & Defronzo, 1998;](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3097192) [Sipsma et al., 2017;](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/7/10/e016379.full.pdf) [Rudolph & Starke, 2020;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235220300623#:~:text=The%20welfare%20state%20suppresses%20crime,have%20any%20effect%20on%20homicide.) [Lenhart, 2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coep.12522).
- **Consumption of Drugs/Temptation Goods -** [World Bank (2014)](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/617631468001808739/pdf/WPS6886.pdf) reviewed the literature on the effect of cash transfers on the consumption of temptation goods and found that cash transfers had no effect on the consumption of temptation goods or ended up reducing it.
- **Physical Health -** Research suggests that countries with higher minimum income benefits tend to do better in terms of mortality, age standardized death rates, and life expectancy [(Fritzell & Nelson, 2014;](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262230551_Welfare_states_and_population_health_The_role_of_minimum_income_benefits_for_mortality) [Beckfield & Bambra, 2016)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jbeckfield/files/beckfield_and_bambra_2016.pdf). Moreover, as welfare state generosity increases, citizens find life more rewarding [(Pacek & Freeman, 2017)](https://www.academia.edu/9138840/The_Welfare_State_and_Quality_of_Life_A_Cross-National_Analysis). This is intuitively true as people with less income gain more from each dollar than people with more income, which suggests that welfare programs (which naturally decrease wealth inequality) would increase happiness [(Griffith, 2004)](https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2289&context=bclr).
- **Mental Health -** While there is a stigma surrounding welfare uptake [(Goodban, 1985;](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30011810) [Krause, 1996)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14265381_Welfare_Participation_and_Self-Esteem_in_Later_Life), evidence suggests that the mental health of people who are in need increases when they are given welfare [(Costello et al., 2010;](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/185890) [Haushofer & Shapiro, 2016)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/THE-SHORT-TERM-IMPACT-OF-UNCONDITIONAL-CASH-TO-THE-Haushofer-Shapiro/261e2442f2b293c05e40d6b9d481ab32d2bcc250?p2df).
- **Nutrition/Growth -** Welfare, particularly food stamps, improves nutritional quality [(World Bank, 2013;](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/13244/755330REVISED000Revised0June0402014.pdf) [Hoynes et al., 2016](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Hoynes-Schanzenbach-Almond-AER-2016.pdf) [Andreyeva et al., 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6022372/), as well as improving child physical development [(Bastagli et al., 2016)](https://odi.org/en/publications/cash-transfers-what-does-the-evidence-say-a-rigorous-review-of-impacts-and-the-role-of-design-and-implementation-features/).
- **Poverty -** Higher social spending is a major predictor of cross-national rates of poverty, with higher social spending reducing poverty significantly in terms of both absolute and relative measures of poverty [(Kenworthy, 1998;](http://www.lisdatacenter.org/wps/liswps/188.pdf) [Smeeding, 2006;](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~noy/300texts/poverty-comparative.pdf) [Burtless & Smeeding, 2007;](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20070213-3.pdf) [Gould & Wething, 2012;](https://files.epi.org/2012/ib339-us-poverty-higher-safety-net-weaker.pdf) [Bastagli et al., 2016)](https://odi.org/en/publications/cash-transfers-what-does-the-evidence-say-a-rigorous-review-of-impacts-and-the-role-of-design-and-implementation-features/).

## Crowding Out

While a crowding out effect potentially exists between welfare and charitable donations, meta-analytic evidence suggests that it is far from a 1:1 crowding out effect, suggesting there is not perfect substitution between social spending and voluntary charitable donations [(Wit & Bekkers, 2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arjen-De-Wit/publication/298709903_Government_Support_and_Charitable_Donations_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Crowding-out_Hypothesis/links/5a6cd604a6fdcc317b17cc03/Government-Support-and-Charitable-Donations-A-Meta-Analysis-of-the-Crowding-out-Hypothesis.pdf).

## Familial Effects

Most studies looking at the United States suggest that welfare has a negative effect on marriage and a positive effect on fertility [(Moffitt, 1998)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230345/), although a notable minority of studies find no relation at all and there is significant variation in findings. However, research looking at OECD member countries in general suggests that an expansion in the welfare state, while increasing fertility, also increases marriage and divorce rates with a stronger effect on marriage, suggesting that welfare states support family formation [(Halla et al., 2013)](https://ftp.iza.org/dp7210.pdf). This may be due to the structure of the American welfare system, as for example in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program there is a requirement that the program provides cash support only to children living without at least one of their biological parents. Medicaid has historically been made available primarily to AFDC recipients and housing programs also tend to have preferences for AFDC recipients, thus having the same bias toward single-parent families [(Moffitt, 1998)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230345/). The American Food Stamp Program (FSP), which did not have the same bias toward single-parent families, was found to improve birth outcomes amongst those who were exposed to the program three months before birth [(Almond et al., 2011)](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/93/2/387/58599/Inside-the-War-on-Poverty-The-Impact-of-Food).

In sum, welfare does not necessarily have negative familial effects but can in fact promote family creation. However, if eligibility requirements for benefits include familial structure, as was the case in the United States, it can have negative familial effects.
