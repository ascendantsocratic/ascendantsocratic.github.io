## Fertility

Pronatalist policies are only modestly effective in increasing births [(Lalive & Zweimüller, 2005;](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=731766)  [Brainerd, 2014)](https://wol.iza.org/articles/can-government-policies-reverse-undesirable-declines-in-fertility). Thus, pronatalist policies need to be combined with openness to increased immigration if they are to have any substantial effect on births. Socioeconomic factors in themselves such as job insecurity appear to only slightly affect fertility [(Clark & Lepinteur, 2022)](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/104/2/386/97750/A-Natural-Experiment-on-Job-Insecurity-and).

## Casual Sex

While people report more positive than negative emotional reactions about their most recent casual sex experience, they are associated with less positive emotional outcomes than sexual behavior in the context of romantic relationships. Moreover, longitudinal studies suggest that people who engage in casual sex have worse emotional health. This effect only appears to be short-run, however. Women tend to feel worse and have more negative emotional outcomes than men [(Wesche et al., 2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2020.1821163).

Higher sociosexuality moderates the effects of casual sex on well-being [(Vrangalova & Ong, 2014)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550614537308). In fact, positive sexuality has a positive impact on overall well-being [(Anderson, 2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23361205/). Being sexually satisfied is also associated with better emotional outcomes from casual sex [(Wesche et al., 2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2020.1821163). However, high sociosexuality is associated with increased probability of relationship dissolution through declines in marital satisfaction over time. This association is weakened with frequent sex, high sexual satisfaction, and low stress [(French et al., 2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619868997).

Women are significantly less likely to be receptive to sexual offers [(Clark & Hatfield, 2008)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J056v02n01_04).

Predictors of within-sex variation in casual sexual regret include worry about sexual reputation, experienced gratification during the encounter, and sociosexual orientation [(Kennair et al., 2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1474704916682903).

## Pornography

### Mental Health Effects

Research suggests that there is a correlation between pornography consumption and anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic symptoms [(Mattebo et al., 2018;](https://doi.org/10.1080/03009734.2018.1534907)  [Camilleri et al., 2020;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7835260/)  [Privara & Bob, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001669). However, it is not clear whether this is due to pornography consumption increasing these things or if pornography consumption serves as a coping mechanism. Men who view pornography as immoral tend to have worse mental health when consuming it, but those who don't view pornography as immoral experience no negative mental health effects unless it is at a high frequency [(Perry, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1177/2156869317728373). Low scrupulosity buffers but does not get rid of the negative relationship between problematic pornography viewing and depression, anxiety, and stress [(Borgogna et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10720162.2019.1567410). Perceived addiction to pornography is also related to psychological distress [(Grubbs et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1037/adb0000114).

### Cognitive Effects

There is a negative association between pornography consumption and gray matter volume in various parts of the brain [(Kühn & Gallinat, 2014;](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.93)  [Muller, 2018)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pornography%E2%80%99s-Effect-on-the-Brain%3A-A-Review-of-in-Muller/881c62a5bc147d5e8d34ffcbb7962e0c5d904263). Men with and without problematic pornography usage differed in their striatal responses to cues predicting erotic subjects but not for cues predicting monetary gains, suggesting that problematic pornography usage may represent a behavioral addiction [(Gola et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2017.78).

### Relationship Effects

Pornography use is not related to the intrapersonal domains of body and self-satisfaction in relationships but is negatively related to the interpersonal domains of sexual and relational satisfaction [(Wright et al., 2017)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314197900_Pornography_Consumption_and_Satisfaction_A_Meta-Analysis_Pornography_and_Satisfaction). This appears to only affect men however.\
HIgher pornography consumption is linked with a greater chance of divorce [(Daines & Shumway, 2011;](https://web.archive.org/web/20150614230353id_/http://www.marriottschool.net/emp/boyer/financeseminar/s11_12/Tyler%20Shumway%20F11.pdf)  [Perry, 2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319508811_Pornography_Use_and_Marital_Separation_Evidence_from_Two-Wave_Panel_Data#:~:text=Binary%20logistic%20regression%20analyses%20showed,as%20well%20as%20relevant%20sociodemographic).

## Polygamy

Women in polygamous marriage have worsened mental health as compared with women in monogamous marriages [(Rahmanian et al., 2021)](https://files.catbox.moe/18e4px.pdf). Children with polygamous parents had significantly worse mental health than those with monogamous parents [(Bahari et al., 2021)](https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-021-04301-7).

The vast majority of human societies have permitted polygamous marriages, but normative monogamy has become the norm more recently. Through suppressing intrasexual competition it reduces crime rates, including rape, murder, assault, robbery and fraud, as well as decreasing personal abuses. Through reducing the competition for younger brides, normative monogamy reduces the spousal age gap, fertility, and gender inequality.It also increases savings, child investment, and economic productivity through shifting male efforts from seeking wives to paternal investment. Through increasing the relatedness within households normative monogamy also reduces intra-household conflict, leading to lower rates of child neglect, abuse, accidental death and homicide [(Henrich et al., 2012)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2011.0290).

Polygamy, through creating a social imbalance where a few economically well-off men marry many wives and many poor men marry late or never, results in more intergroup conflict [(Koos & Neupert-Wentz, 2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002719859636). Polygamy helps to partially explain sex differences in mortality rates in some nations due to the intensity of male mating competition [(Kruger, 2010)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491000800205).

## Birth Control

Publicly funded family planning has been shown to generate significant cost savings for the government [(Forrest & Samara, 1996;](https://doi.org/10.2307/2135837)  [Amaral et al., 2007;](https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1475-6773.2007.00702.X)  [Frost et al., 2008;](https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.0.0060)  [Foster et al., 2009)](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2007.129353). For example, [Foster et al. (2014)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12080) found that for every dollar spent on the family planning program it saved taxpayers $7.09. This was due to lower expenditures from STD testing and prevention of unplanned births.

## Sexual Education

Abstinence-only education does not appear to protect against pregnancy and STIs [(Santelli et al., 2006)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16387256/), and also contains scientifically inaccurate information on the issues of condom efficacy and gender stereotypes [(Santelli, 2007)](https://doi.org/10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b). Moreover, abstinence-only interventions only have a very small overall effect on abstinent behavior [(Silva, 2002)](https://doi.org/10.1093/HER/17.4.471).

Comprehensive sex education appears to successfully delay sexual initiation [(Santelli, 2007;](https://doi.org/10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b)  [Tortolero et al., 2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818029/), as well as the development of healthy relationships, prevention of partner violence, prevention of child sex abuse, improved social/emotional learning, and increased media literacy [(Goldfarb & Lieberman, 2020)](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(20)30456-0/fulltext). Teaching about contraception is not associated with increased risk of adolescent sexual activity or STDs [(Kohler et al., 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.08.026).
