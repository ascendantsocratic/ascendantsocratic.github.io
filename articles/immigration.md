**Labor Market Effects**

The overall evidence suggests that immigrants have a small negative aggregate effect on native employment and wages in the short run [(Longhi et al., 2004;](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/a-meta-analytic-assessment-of-the-effect-of-immigration-on-wages-3) [Longhi et al., 2010;](https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y) [Constant, 2014;](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-migrants-take-the-jobs-of-native-workers) [Aubry et al., 2021)](https://lem.univ-lille.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/laboratoires/lem/doc_de_travail_2021/DT2021-04.pdf), and a positive effect on both in the long run following labor market adjustment [(Edo, 2018)](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1111/joes.12300). This short-term negative effect is not distributed evenly across the entire economy but is concentrated in the industries where the immigrants are concentrated in [(Kim & Sakamoto, 2013)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00380237.2013.766834), which is commonly but not always in low-skill industries [(Camarota, 1998;](https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/articles/1998/wagestudy/wages.pdf) [Turner & Boulder, 2017)](https://economics.nd.edu/assets/263109/jmp_turner.pdf). Immigration may also improve the health of native workers [(Giuntella, 2020)](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrants-improve-health-of-native-workers).

**Brain Drain**

Brain drain, the phenomenon of educated people leaving poorer countries to go to richer countries where they will find better economic opportunities. In poor countries, brain drain can change the skill structure of the labor force, cause labor shortages, and affect fiscal policy, but can also generate remittances and other benefits from expatriates and returnees. In spite of remittances, evidence suggests there are many more losers than winners among developing countries. Whether a country gains or loses depends on country-specific factors, such as level and composition of migration, the country's level of development, population size, language, and geographic location. Brain drain appears to decrease with economic development [(Docquier, 2014)](https://wol.iza.org/articles/brain-drain-from-developing-countries).

**Economic Growth**

Immigration is positively associated with economic growth per person [(Morley, 2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176505002594), with the majority of research suggesting that immigration causes higher economic growth per person [(Feridun, 2004;](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/DOES-IMMIGRATION-HAVE-AN-IMPACT-ON-ECONOMIC-AND-Feridun/d28ac1f06ddca71a6b4d22a33467ab40e23e22de)  [Boubtane et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1111/labr.12017). This is because immigration increases labor supply, human capital accumulation, savings rate, total factor productivity, and technological progress [(Bodvarsson & Van den berg, 2009;](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-77796-0_9)  [Peri, 2012;](https://doi.org/10.3386/W15507)  [Mongelli & Martinez, 2018)](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC109196). Immigration also tends to increase the business failure rate, which leads to higher levels of entrepreneurship and a more dynamic economy [(Murphy & Weber, 2016)](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JEPP-01-2015-0002/full/html). High-skilled immigration creates positive spillover effects for innovation in the economy Highly-skilled immigrants have positive spillovers for innovation in the economy [(Longhi et al., 2010)](https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y).
To maximize economic benefits, governments should have economic integration policies to ease transfer of foreign human capital [(Aydemir, 2020)](https://wol.iza.org/articles/skill-based-immigration-economic-integration-and-economic-performance).

**Crime**

The overall research suggests that there is a negative immigration-crime association, but one which is very weak and has significant variation across studies [(Lee & Martinez, 2009;](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235261537_Immigration_reduces_crime_An_emerging_scholarly_consensus)  [Ousey & Kubrin, 2018)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092026). This is unlikely to be due to reporting bias, as there is a high degree of correspondence between self-reports of arrest and official reports of arrest amongst immigrants, suggesting their lower levels of offending are not due to under-reporting [(Bersani & Piquero)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-016-9314-9).

Correlates of immigrant crime include national IQs and Islam prevalence in the home countries [(Kirkegaard, 2014a;](https://openpsych.net/paper/14/)  [Kirkegaard, 2014b;](https://openpsych.net/paper/13/)  [Kirkegaard & Becker, 2017)](https://openpsych.net/paper/50/), whether the immigrants are disproportionately young and male [(Billy & Packard, 2020)](https://files.catbox.moe/zehcls.pdf), andÂ  the degree to which the increase in immigrant population increases ethnic diversity/heterogeneity [(Quick & Law, 2015;](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19950-4_14)  [Sydes, 2017a;](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:684766)  [Sydes, 2017b)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022427817696955).

**Fiscal Impact**

Most research suggests that the net fiscal impact of immigration is highly varied but generally zero [(OECD, 2013;](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/IMO-2013-chap3-fiscal-impact-of-immigration.pdf)  [Hennessey & Hagen-Zanker, 2020)](http://cdn-odi-production.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/documents/fiscal_space_paper_final.pdf). However, this is dependent on the policy environment, including the extent to which labor markets absorb migrants, the informality of labor markets and migrants' rights to work and receive welfare benefits [(Hennessey & Hagen-Zanker, 2020)](http://cdn-odi-production.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/documents/fiscal_space_paper_final.pdf). It is also dependent on the age of immigrants and their migration category. Labor/highly educated migrants tend to have a higher fiscal position than humanitarian migrants for example due to their more favorable labor market outcomes [(Auerbach & Oreopoulos, 2000;](https://doi.org/10.1086/654705)  [OECD, 2013;](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/IMO-2013-chap3-fiscal-impact-of-immigration.pdf)  [Orrenius, 2017)](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/institute/working-papers/17-13.pdf). Refugee or non-western immigration has been almost unanimously shown to have a negative effect on the fiscal balance [(Dustmann & Frattini, 2014;](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12181)  [Zsolt, 2018)](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.12520). With proper integration of refugees however, it is possible that the fiscal gains in the long-term due to refugees contributing to the economy may significantly outweigh the short-term costs [(Kancs & Lecca, 2017)](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/sites/futurium/files/jrc107441_wp_kancs_and_lecca_2017_4.pdf).

More welfare generosity predicts increased international migration to a country, an effect known as the welfare magnet effect [(Dodson, 2001;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818800000405)  [Heizmann et al., 2018;](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/8/3/83/htm)  [Jakubiak, 2019;](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJM-10-2017-0274/full/html)  [Agersnap et al., 2020)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26454/w26454.pdf).

**Public Opinion**

People tend to favor restrictive immigration policies, particularly against immigrants of different ethnicities. Concerns about ethnic and cultural identity play a stronger role than economic concerns in driving these attitudes [(Sides & Citrin, 2007;](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4497304)  [Javdani, 2020)](https://wol.iza.org/articles/public-attitudes-toward-immigration-determinants-and-unknowns).

Immigration policy preferences regarding which types of immigrants should be let in tend to be based on accurate stereotypes about immigrants themselves [(Carl, 2016;](https://openpsych.net/files/papers/Carl_2016b.pdf)  [Kirkegaard et al., 2020)](https://files.catbox.moe/tf1f6n.pdf).

Contact tends to reduce immigration-related fears for left-leaning but not right-leaning voters [(Homola & Tavits, 2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0010414017740590).

Natives tend to support redistribution less when the share of immigrants in their resident region is higher. This effect is driven by areas with large welfare states and by centrist or rightist respondents [(Alesina et al., 2019)](https://docs.iza.org/dp12130.pdf).

Exposure to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in natives' hostility toward refugees and immigrants and support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies [(Hooghe et al., 2008)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055418000813). Similarly research in Australia has suggested that Australians living in electoral districts with higher percentages of non-white immigrants are more likely to want lower immigrant numbers than those living in districts with fewer non-white immigrants [(Coma & Smith, 2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10361146.2018.1450357).

**Immigration Enforcement**

Regulations on immigration in general have a significant effect on immigration flows, suggesting that states are able to control their borders [(Helbling & Leblang, 2018)](https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6765.12279). Enforcement of immigration, whether it be on the border or interior of a country, reduces the probability that an individual will decide to illegally migrate [(Orrenius, 2019)](https://wol.iza.org/articles/enforcement-and-illegal-migration). However, immigration enforcement is costly to the government, decreases the labor force, reduces real GDP, and has no meaningful effects on crime [(Miles & Cox, 2014;](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/680935?journalCode=jle)  [Gitis & Collins, 2015)](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-budgetary-and-economic-costs-of-addressing-unauthorized-immigration-alt/).

**Prices**

In general, immigration tends to reduce prices with the exception of housing prices [(Longhi et al., 2010;](https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y) [MAC, 2018)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/741926/Final_EEA_report.PDF). Data from meta-analyses suggest that immigration on the aggregate increases home prices [(Larkin et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718302481#:~:text=Using%20an%20instrumental%20variables%20strategy,locating%20in%20the%20same%20provinces.). For example, [Cochrane & Poot (2021)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347406420_Effects_of_Immigration_on_Local_Housing_Markets) finds that a 1% increase in immigration in a city increases rents by 0.5-1%, with the effect on prices being about double of that. Nonetheless, the effect can vary in part due to the degree to which natives respond by moving from areas that migrants settle in. However, because in the long-run wages of natives rise on average due to immigration, the average rent burden does not change [(Longhi et al., 2010)](https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y).

**Electoral Effects**

Immigration to the US is negatively associated with republican vote share [(Mayda et al., 2016)](https://files.catbox.moe/6zjldh.pdf) and immigration status positively predicts democratic affiliation [(Hawley, 2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ssqu.12621). However, while this is a net effect favoring more left-wing ideologies, natives tend to respond to immigration through support for extreme right political parties and a more protectionist response to immigration [(Finseraas et al., 2015;](https://www.sv.uio.no/esop/english/research/news-and-events/events/conferences-and-seminars/2015/Docs/skillcell.pdf)  [Vasilakis, 2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/imig.12409).

**Educational Effects**

Higher concentration has a negative or null effect on the educational outcomes of native children [(Jensen, 2021)](https://wol.iza.org/articles/immigrants-in-classroom-and-effects-on-native-children). The negative effects tend to be small, vary by country, and seem to be related to disadvantaged immigrants or refugees. This may be remedied by improving support and immigrant children's language acquisition.

Immigration tends to lead to a schooling choice flight amongst students [(Murray, 2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775716301789). This tends to increase school segregation, with wealthier locals being more likely to opt out of private schooling into private schools [(Hook & Snyder, 2007;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-007-9035-8)  [Dottori & Shen, 2009;](https://docs.iza.org/dp3946.pdf) [Dottori et al., 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002205311300121X). Immigration also leads to a decrease in public education expenditures [(Coen-Pirani, 2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272711000788), with [Speciale (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272712000382) estimating that the elasticity of education spending with respect to immigrant population share is -0.15.

**Inequality Effects**

Immigration tends to increase population-level socioeconomic inequality, although it does not increase native wage inequality [(Card, 2009;](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/immigration-and-inequality.pdf)  [Kirkegaard & Tranberg, 2015)](https://openpsych.net/files/papers/Kirkegaard_2015a.pdf).
