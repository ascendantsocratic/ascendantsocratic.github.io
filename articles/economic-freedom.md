**Economic freedom = based**

A 2013 systematic literature review on the effects of economic freedom found that in the vast majority of studies that cite the economic freedom index, it is associated with mostly good outcomes [(Hall & Lawson, 2013)]( https://doi.org/10.1111/coep.12010). The only main exception to this is that some of the negative studies suggested that economic freedom increases income inequality. There is a vast literature of studies which look at the effects of economic freedom in a wide variety of domains:

- **Economic Growth -** [Doucouliagos & Ulubasoglu (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2005.06.003) used meta-analytic techniques to the literature on economic freedom and economic growth and found that there is a positive association between the two. Granger causality analysis suggests that for both industrial and nonindustrial countries, this is a positive feedback loop in which both variables cause one another [(Farr et al., 1998)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.482.8647&rep=rep1&type=pdf). This effect operates through a number of channels, which include low money growth rate, small role played by government enterprises, rare negative real interest rates, small difference between the official and black-market exchange rates, large size of the trade sector, and the freedom of citizens to engage in capital transactions with foreigners [(Scully, 2002)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025774).
- **Inequality -** Consistent with [Hall & Lawson (2013)]( https://doi.org/10.1111/coep.12010), some research does suggest that economic freedom increases income inequality [(Carter, 2007)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-006-9078-0), although there is no clear consensus [(Apergis et al., 2013;]( https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2012.00343.x) [Apergis, 2015)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ipf/finteo/v39y2015i4p349-370.html). This is consistent with the well-known hypothesized tradeoff between equity and efficiency [(Scully, 2002)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025774), in which countries with higher economic growth have to sacrifice a level of economic inequality. However, many studies which find that economic freedom increases inequality have notable caveats to it. For example, [Ahmed (2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7099/5/2/18) finds that this effect is attenuated with democratic regimes, and [Bauer (2016)](https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/honors/597/) finds that this is balanced out by an overall higher quality of life among citizens who live under conditions of higher economic freedom.
- **Poverty and Social Mobility -** Economic freedom is associated with both lower poverty [(Hasan et al., 2003)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5021345_Poverty_and_Economic_Freedom_Evidence_from_Cross-Country_Data) and increased social mobility [(Elbrecht, 2013)](https://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:204636/datastream/PDF/view).
- **Innovation -** Economic freedom increases innovation [(Erkan, 2015;](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Economic-Freedom-and-Innovation-Erkan/f17a0d7f0cdc279a506b6da67eb025c73a74a721) [Zhu & Zhu, 2017)]([https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.qref.2016.04.003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976916300114)).
- **Labor Markets -** Economic freedom reduces unemployment, and increases labor force participation and employment-population ratios [(Feldmann, 2007;](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20111958?seq=1) [Heller & Stephenson, 2013)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coep.12031).
- **Debt Risk -** Even after controlling for a variety of factors, lower economic freedom results in a significantly higher borrowing cost for a country [(Roychoudhury & Lawson, 2010)](https://0x0.la/u/KGY9lnX.pdf).
- **Quality of Life -** Economic freedom is significantly positively associated with a multitude of indicators of quality of life [(Esposto & Zaleski, 1999;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009068829135) [Nikolaev, 2014)](http://journal.apee.org/index.php/2014.Fall.JPE_part5.pdf), including happiness [(Veenhoven, 2000;](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/18509341.pdf) [Gropper et al., 2011;](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2011/5/cj31n2-4.pdf#page=17) [Gehring, 2013;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X13001150?via%3Dihub) [Yilmaz & Tag, 2016;](https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2016/06/shsconf_rptss2016_01109.pdf) [Jackson, 2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-016-9770-9), longer life expectancy [(Powell, 2003)](https://www.mercatus.org/students/research/working-papers/private-property-rights-economic-freedom-and-well-being), and increased health, education, and disease prevention [(Stroup, 2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X0600180X).
- **Civil Society -** Economic freedom is associated with greater democracy [(Yevdokimov et al., 2018)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/231765996.pdf),  greater political freedom [(Lawson & Clark, 2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268110000430), lower governmental corruption [(Cramer, 2020)](https://uca.edu/cahss/files/2020/07/02-Cramer-CLA-2020.pdf), a reduction in conflict [(Tures, 2003)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.4651&rep=rep1&type=pdf), and greater tolerance of different groups of people [(Berggren & Nilsson, 2012;](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2045577#:~:text=Regression%20analysis%20of%20up%20to,by%20how%20free%20markets%20are) [Berggren & Nilsson, 2020)](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2021-01/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2020-chapter-3.pdf).
- **Air Quality -** Economic freedom appears to create incentives to abate local air pollution such as fine particulate matter, although such incentives do not appear to be created for carbon dioxide emissions which are more global in nature [(Wood & Herzog, 2014)](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-freedom-and-air-quality.pdf). This would make sense given the difficulty of coordination on an international scale which is required to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
