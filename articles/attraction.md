## Social Factors

### Mental Illness

Strong genetic selection exists against schizophrenia, autism, and anorexia nervosa [(Power et al., 2013)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/1390257), and there appears to be genetic selection for ADHD [(Rokeach & Wiener, 2014;](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1087054714538660)  [Ostergaard et al., 2017)](https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(17)30205-8/fulltext).

Tinder users tend to be higher on dark triad traits and sociosexuality, and those with higher dark triad traits and sociosexuality are more motivated to use Tinder for short-term mating [(Sevi, 2019)](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1614-0001/a000297).

[McDonald et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886911005708) found that there are two distinct factors of dark triad life history strategies. First is a fast life strategy factor that includes the impulsive antisociality facet of psychopathy, the entitlement/exploitativeness facet of narcissism, machiavellianism, unrestricted sociosexuality, and aggression. Second is a slow life strategy factor that includes the fearless dominance facet of psychopathy and the leadership/authority and grandiose exhibitionism facets of narcissism.

[Davis et al. (2018)](https://evolutionlab.nipissingu.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2019/09/Davis2019_Article_TheRelationsBetweenLifeHistory.pdf) found that narcissism predicted a slow strategy, while psychopathy and status-driven risk taking predicted a fast strategy. Machiavellianism and everyday sadism were not predictors of life history strategy.

Dark triad personalities are significantly more attractive to women [(Carter et al., 2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273809664_The_Dark_Triad_personality_Attractiveness_to_women).

Personality factors most strongly linked to susceptibility to infidelity are low Conscientiousness, high Narcissism, and high Psychoticism [(Buss & Shackelford, 1997)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656697921759?via%3Dihub).

### Intelligence and Personality

Individuals at the upper and lower ends of the intelligence distribution are less likely to have sex [(Halpern et al., 2000)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10706169/).

The only personality trait that affects physical attractiveness is extraversion, which has a positive effect [(Anderson et al., 2001)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.81.1.116).

Men tend to prefer niceness in women, but women do not prefer niceness in men [(Birnbaum et al., 2014)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167214543879). Happiness is the most attractive female emotion expression, and one of the least attractive in males [(Tracy et al., 2011)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0022902).

### Bullying

Intrasexual competition comprises both competitor derogation and self-promotion. Bullying can be seen as a form of intrasexual competition in that it involves competitor derogation. This is consistent with evidence suggesting that male and female adolescent bullies are engaging in or cognizing about self-promotion strategies to improve physical appearance as well. Bullied adolescents are also concerned with appearance but mostly due to reduced self-esteem, body-esteem, and emotional problems from getting bullied [(Lee, 2017)](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/90332/). Bullying behavior predicts an increase in sexual opportunities [(Volk et al., 2015;](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704915613909)  [Provenzano et al., 2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321812090_Do_Bullies_Have_More_Sex_The_Role_of_Personality).

### Status and Wealth

Male status has a positive effect on reproductive success [(Rueden & Jaeggi, 2016)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1606800113). However, only high status men and not high status women are seen as more attractive [(DeWall & Maner, 2008)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/147470490800600209).

High-income men have more biological children than do low-income men and high-income women. However, intelligence decreases the number of offspring and frequency of sex for both men and women [(Hopcroft, 2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513805000619?via%3Dihub).

Greater income does not buy more sex, nor more sexual partners [(Blanchflower & Oswald, 2004)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170109063039/https://www.nber.org/papers/w10499). However, while men tend not to care about income in online dating, women do [(Ong & Wang, 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268114003242). Women are 1000 times more sensitive to a man's salary than the other way around when it comes to rating attractiveness [(Wang et al., 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109051381730315X).

## Physical Factors

### Health

Physiological measures of health such as immune function, oxidative stress and semen quality do not appear to be strongly related to mating success [(Foo et al., 2017)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.160603). Only female waist-to-hip ratio and weight appear to predict both attractiveness and health. Attractiveness has an overall relationship with health among women, but male attractiveness does not appear to be related to male health [(Weeden & Sabini, 2005)](http://femininebeauty.info/f/weeden.sabini.pdf).

### Shoulder-Hip-Waist Ratios

Men with higher shoulder to hip ratios and women with low waist to hip ratios have sexual intercourse at an earlier age, more sexual partners, more extrapair copulations, and having themselves been extrapair copulation partners [(Hughes & Gallup, 2003)](https://www.psy.uq.edu.au/~uqbziets/Hughes2003%20-%20Shoulder%20to%20hip%20ratio.pdf). A low waist-hip ratio is viewed cross-culturally as attractive [(Singh et al., 2010)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-07977-002). Even blind men prefer a low waist-top-hip ratio [(Karremans et al., 2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513809001093?via%3Dihub).

### Facial Morphology

Facial width-to-height ratio is positively associated with aggression [(Haselhuhn et al., 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4388848/), psychopathic traits [(Anderl et al., 2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886915005759), and achievement drive [(Lewis et al., 2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886912000049). Those with a higher facial width-to-height ratio tend to achieve higher social status [(Hahn et al., 2017)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8986/4ab104a36c75ee30d825900d6a31a582c693.pdf).

Facial width was also related to attractiveness to women for short-term but not long-term relationships [(Valentine et al., 2014)](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2727&context=soss_research). Facially dominant looking boys are more likely to report coital opportunity than facially submissive looking boys [(Mazur et al., 1994)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-44767-001).

### Body Attractiveness

Upper body strength is the primary determinant of male body attractiveness, along with tallness and leanness [(Sell et al., 2017)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.1819#d3e552). Across cultures, there is an inverse linear relationship between physically attractiveness and body fatness or BMI [(Wang et al., 2015)](https://peerj.com/articles/1155/).

### Height

There is a strong inverse association between height and suicide [(Magnusson et al., 2005)](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373).

Male tallness is directionally selected for [(Mueller & Mazur, 2001)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002650100370). Women prefer on average a larger height difference between themselves and their partner than men do. Women are most satisfied when their partner is 21 cm taller, while men are most satisfied when they are 8cm taller than their partner [(Stulp et al., 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913000020).

Height in men is negatively associated with intrasexual competitiveness [(Polo et al., 2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1474704917749172). Intrasexual competition is positively correlated with height over-report [(Mailhos et al., 2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886917302003?via%3Dihub).

Short children are more likely to be bullied than their taller peers [(Voss & Mulligan, 2000)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC32258/pdf/612.pdf).

### Voice Pitch

Individuals with lower-pitched voices are more likely to win elected office but are not actually better leaders [(Klofstad & Anderson, 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513817301770?via%3Dihub). CEOs with deeper voices manage larger companies and thus make more money [(Mayew et al., 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513813000238). Lower-pitched voices are perceived by women to be more attractive and to signify a higher socioeconomic status [(O'Connor et al., 2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109051381400052X?via%3Dihub). Low male voice pitch is preferred mainly in short-term mating contexts rather than in long-term committed ones, and this is greatest when women are in the fertile phase of their ovulatory cycles. Lower male voice pitch correlated with higher self-reported mating success [(Puts, 2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513805000176). Lower voice pitch being preferred mainly in short-term mating contexts is mediated by the relation between voice pitch and perceived infidelity by females [(O'Connor et al., 2014b)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913012324?via%3Dihub). While male voice pitch but not female voice pitch is related to reproductive outcomes, voice pitch in men does not predict child morality [(Apicella et al., 2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2391230/).

### Facial Shape

Across cultures, facial averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphism are attractive in both male and female faces [(Rhodes, 2006)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16318594/). This suggests that there exists some good candidates for biologically based standards of beauty.

## Sperm Count

Across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, there has been a 50-60% decline in sperm counts between 1973 and 2011 [(Levine et al., 2017)](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689?login=false).

## Race

Men of all races tend to rate Asian women as being relatively attractive and black women as being relatively unattractive, although tend to also be biased in favor of their own race. Numbers are mixed for white women and latina women. Women tend to rate their own race as being the most attractive [(Rudder, 2014)](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/raceandattraction20092014.html).

Europeans living in countries with a large foreign-born population have an increased preference for minority groups [(Potarca & Mills, 2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271837870_Racial_Preferences_in_Online_Dating_across_European_Countries).

## Beauty

There is interrater reliability in terms of who people find is and is not attractive both within and across cultures. Moreover, attractive children and adults are judged and treated more positively than unattractive children and adults, even by those who know them, and attractive children and adults exhibit more positive behaviors and traits [(Langlois et al., 2000)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825783/). People assessed as more physically attractive at age 15 had higher socioeconomic status at age 36 and were more likely to be married, even after controlling for other factors [(Benzeval et al., 2013)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063975).

## Asking Out

Men tend to prefer to ask out women and ask out women more. On the other hand, women tend to prefer to be asked out and ask out men less. This has not changed in spite of great changes in gender relations over the past few decades. This may be because women evolutionarily want to demonstrate sexual fidelity to attract an ideal partner [(Mills, 2011)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-how-and-why-sex-differences/201104/why-dont-women-ask-men-out-first-dates).

## Creepiness and Sexual Harassment

Men are perceived as being more creepy than women and women are more likely to associate sexual threat with creepiness. Unusual nonverbal behavior and unpredictability were also predictors of creepiness. This is consistent with the hypothesis that being creeped out is an evolved adaptive emotional response [(McAndrew & Koehnke, 2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0732118X16300320).

Attractiveness and high social status are predictive of tolerance for sexual harassment [(Wuensch & Moore, 2004;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15074507/)  [Angelone et al., 2009)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19030980/).

## Sexuality

### Monogamy/Promiscuity

Having multiple sex partners is not related to increased anxiety or depression but is related to alcohol and drug dependence issues [(Whitbourne et al., 2013)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/the-long-term-psychological-effects-multiple-sex-partners).

Across cultures, women tend to suppress female sexuality much more than men. This is because women sex is a limited resource that women use to negotiate with men, and scarcity gives women an advantage [(Baumeister & Twenge, 2002)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.166).

Men who transition into monogamous behavior, a less competitive mode of sexual behavior, reduce their risk of violence [(Seffrin, 2016)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2016.1216153?journalCode=rjqy20).

The number of sexual partners individuals had in their lifetimes was associated with lower levels of sexual quality, communication, and relationship stability [(Busby et al., 2013)](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1111/pere.12009).

People with more premarital sex partners tend to have higher divorse rates [(Wolfinger, 2016)](https://archive.ph/Mj4eo).

Sexual and emotional infidelity are related to sexual and emotional promiscuity [(Pinto & Arantes, 2017)](https://www.athensjournals.gr/social/2017-4-4-3-Pinto.pdf).

Across cultures, women's virginity is viewed as a gift and women are viewed as sexually submissive to men. On the other hand, male virginity was seen as a failure to men's masculinity [(Tejada, 2020)](https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context=senior_comm).

### Sex Drive/Sociosexuality

Men tend to have a higher sex drive and greater sociosexuality than women across countries [(Baumeister et al., 2001;](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Is-There-a-Gender-Difference-in-Strength-of-Sex-and-Baumeister-Catanese/5f8446340d4ed375007351539e7993fa44e2e31b?p2df)  [Lippa, 2009)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17975724/). The evidence on sociosexuality consistent with a hybrid model in which both biological and social structural influences contribute to sex differences, while sex drive is consistent with a biological model.

### Virginity

Female adolescents who had sex had significant decreases in peer acceptance over time, while male adolescents who had sex had significant increases in peer acceptance. Interestingly however, findings for making out suggested that female adolescents had increases in peer acceptance and male adolescents had decreases in peer acceptance [(Kreager et al., 2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-016-0618-x).

### Sexual Activity

Penile-vaginal intercourse is associated with a wide range of better psychological and physiological health indices. Other activities have weaker, null, or inverse associations with health indices [(Brody, 2010)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01677.x#b34).

## Other Attractiveness

Physical attractiveness and race are the strongest predictors of decisions in a swiping experiment [(Chopik & Johnson, 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656621000131?via%3Dihub).

For men, being unattractive decreases the likelihood of finding a partner or finding a partner of a higher educational level, but not for women [(Pastor, 2017)](https://reis.cis.es//REIS/PDF/REIS_159_07_ENGLISH1499424514902.pdf).

Identical twins have more similar preferences for traits such as height, skin color, hair color and length, chest hair, facial hair, and breast size, suggesting genetic effects. Heritability estimates range from zero to 57% [(Verweij et al., 2012)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233725541_Evidence_for_Genetic_Variation_in_Human_Mate_Preferences_for_Sexually_Dimorphic_Physical_Traits).

There is a robust association between physical attractiveness and various measures of health. This suggests that physical attractiveness is a phenotypic marker for health [(Nedelec & Beaver, 2014)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-29517-001).

Those who are physically more attractive tend to be more optimistic and have higher social mobility [(Urbatsch, 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X17305215?via%3Dihub).

Physically attractive people are perceived as more sociable, dominant, sexually warm, mentally healthy, intelligent, and socially skilled. However, relationships between physical attractiveness and personality or mental ability are generally trivial, although good-looking people were less lonely, less socially anxious, more popular, more socially skilled, and more sexually experienced. Self-ratings of physical attractiveness are positively correlated with more attributes than actual physical attractiveness [(Feingold, 1992)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-2909.111.2.304).

More attractive people are less likely to be arrested and convicted [(Beaver et al., 2019)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13218719.2019.1618750?journalCode=tppl20).

Physically attractive workers are more confident, have better oral skills, and are independently considered more able by employers, increasing their wages [(Mobius & Rosenblat, 2006)](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3043406/mobius_beauty.pdf?s).

## Relationships

### Loneliness and Rejection

Social rejection is reflected in the part of the brain that experiences physical pain, suggesting that experiencing rejection is neurologically analogous to experiencing physical pain [(Kross et al., 2011)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1102693108). Greater social connection is associated with a reduced risk of early death. Social isolation and loneliness significantly increase premature mortality [(Lunstad et al., 2010;](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316)  [Sliwa, 2017)](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/08/lonely-die).

Subjective well-being is associated with higher productivity and improved country economic performance [(DiMaria et al., 2019)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-019-00074-1).

Individuals who have poor mating performance experience more negative emotions, fewer positive emotions, and are less satisfied with their lives [(Apostolou et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886918305348?via%3Dihub). In fact, even viewing pictures of a romantic partner reduces experimental pain [(Younger et al., 2010)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013309).

Warm partner contact is related to lower cardiovascular reactivity, suggesting that affectionate relationships with a partner may contribute to someone being less reactive to stressful life events [(Grewen et al., 2010)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08964280309596065).

### Single Motherhood

The less time fathers spend with their children,, the more conduct problems their children had, but only if fathers did not engage in antisocial behavior. If they are high in anti-social behavior, time spent with their children increases the conduct problems of their children [(Jaffee et al., 2003)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12625439/).

### Marriage and Divorce

There is a positive relationship between premarital sex and risk of divorse. This is not a direct causal effect, but rather due to prior unobserved differences such as the willingness to break traditional norms [(Kahn & London, 1991)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/352992?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).

Premarital cohabitation is negatively related to marital happiness and positively related to conflict [(James & Beattie, 2012)](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/91/2/635/2235785).

Women are more likely to initiate divorce than men, but men and women are equally likely to initiate a breakup of a non-marriage relationship [(LaBier, 2015)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-resilience/201508/women-initiate-divorce-much-more-men-heres-why). It is hypothesized that the difference in marriage is due to women being more likely to express overt conflict and dissatisfaction about the state of the marriage, while the man is more likely to feel troubled but fine with the way things are. On the other hand, with non-marital but committed relationships which are often composed of younger people, the relationships tend to be formed in a more egalitarian manner which means that both people are equally likely to address any conflicts that occur.

## Politics and Sexuality

Attractive candidates tend to get more votes. Politically unpopular parties tend to be represented by physically unattractive candidates [(Efrain & Patterson, 1974)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0081881).

Conservatives are less likely to use a short-term mating strategy that is distinctive from their long-term strategy [(Muggleton & Fincher, 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513818300643?via%3Dihub).

Even after controlling for socioeconomic status, more attractive individuals are more likely to report higher levels of political efficacy, identify as conservative, and identify as Republican [(Peterson & Palmer, 2017)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-the-life-sciences/article/abs/effects-of-physical-attractiveness-on-political-beliefs/D5214D0CAE37EE5947B7BF29762547EE).

[Price et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513816303907) found that sociopolitical egalitarianism is negatively related to bodily formidability but is unrelated to other measures of facial formidability or attractiveness.

Both self-rated attractiveness and attractiveness rated by other people predict the endorsement of a belief in a just world and are related to a person's level of life satisfaction [(Westfall et al., 2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0033294118763172).

## Sexism

Women tend to approve of benevolent sexist men but disapprove of hostile sexist men [(Kilianski & Rudman, 1998)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laurie-Rudman/publication/251261112_Wanting_It_Both_Ways_Do_Women_Approve_of_Benevolent_Sexism/links/597f8e72458515687b4bb94f/Wanting-It-Both-Ways-Do-Women-Approve-of-Benevolent-Sexism.pdf). Women tend to also prefer men with benevolent sexist attitudes over those without them, despite also perceiving them as patronizing and undermining [(Bohner et al., 2009;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-009-9665-x)  [Gul & Kupfer, 2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167218781000). Benevolent sexism in women is associated with greater preferences for high-resource partners, while hostile sexism in men is associated with stronger preferences for physically attractive partners. This along with other evidence suggests that women's desire for high-resource partners is related to a protection and security-provision motive, while men's desire for attractive partners is related to a dominance-based status-marker motive [(Sibley & Overall, 2011)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0361684311401838).

Women's sex role ideology, but not men's, is negatively related to marital happiness and stability, with nontraditional women being less happy and more likely to be separated or divorced [(Lueptow et al., 1989)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/019251389010003005).
