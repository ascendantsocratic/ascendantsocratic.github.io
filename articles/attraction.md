## Social Factors

### Mental Illness

Strong genetic selection exists against schizophrenia, autism, and anorexia nervosa [(Power et al., 2013)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/1390257), and there appears to be genetic selection for ADHD [(Rokeach & Wiener, 2014;](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1087054714538660)  [Ostergaard et al., 2017)](https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(17)30205-8/fulltext).

Tinder users tend to be higher on dark triad traits and sociosexuality, and those with higher dark triad traits and sociosexuality are more motivated to use Tinder for short-term mating [(Sevi, 2019)](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1614-0001/a000297).

[McDonald et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886911005708) found that there are two distinct factors of dark triad life history strategies. First is a fast life strategy factor that includes the impulsive antisociality facet of psychopathy, the entitlement/exploitativeness facet of narcissism, machiavellianism, unrestricted sociosexuality, and aggression. Second is a slow life strategy factor that includes the fearless dominance facet of psychopathy and the leadership/authority and grandiose exhibitionism facets of narcissism.

[Davis et al. (2018)](https://evolutionlab.nipissingu.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2019/09/Davis2019_Article_TheRelationsBetweenLifeHistory.pdf) found that narcissism predicted a slow strategy, while psychopathy and status-driven risk taking predicted a fast strategy. Machiavellianism and everyday sadism were not predictors of life history strategy.

Dark triad personalities are significantly more attractive to women [(Carter et al., 2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273809664_The_Dark_Triad_personality_Attractiveness_to_women).

Personality factors most strongly linked to susceptibility to infidelity are low Conscientiousness, high Narcissism, and high Psychoticism [(Buss & Shackelford, 1997)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656697921759?via%3Dihub).

### Intelligence and Personality

Individuals at the upper and lower ends of the intelligence distribution are less likely to have sex [(Halpern et al., 2000)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10706169/).

The only personality trait that affects physical attractiveness is extraversion, which has a positive effect [(Anderson et al., 2001)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.81.1.116).

Men tend to prefer niceness in women, but women do not prefer niceness in men [(Birnbaum et al., 2014)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167214543879). Happiness is the most attractive female emotion expression, and one of the least attractive in males [(Tracy et al., 2011)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0022902).

### Bullying

Intrasexual competition comprises both competitor derogation and self-promotion. Bullying can be seen as a form of intrasexual competition in that it involves competitor derogation. This is consistent with evidence suggesting that male and female adolescent bullies are engaging in or cognizing about self-promotion strategies to improve physical appearance as well. Bullied adolescents are also concerned with appearance but mostly due to reduced self-esteem, body-esteem, and emotional problems from getting bullied [(Lee, 2017)](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/90332/). Bullying behavior predicts an increase in sexual opportunities [(Volk et al., 2015;](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704915613909)  [Provenzano et al., 2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321812090_Do_Bullies_Have_More_Sex_The_Role_of_Personality).

### Status and Wealth

Male status has a positive effect on reproductive success [(Rueden & Jaeggi, 2016)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1606800113). However, only high status men and not high status women are seen as more attractive [(DeWall & Maner, 2008)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/147470490800600209).

High-income men have more biological children than do low-income men and high-income women. However, intelligence decreases the number of offspring and frequency of sex for both men and women [(Hopcroft, 2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513805000619?via%3Dihub).

Greater income does not buy more sex, nor more sexual partners [(Blanchflower & Oswald, 2004)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170109063039/https://www.nber.org/papers/w10499). However, while men tend not to care about income in online dating, women do [(Ong & Wang, 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268114003242). Women are 1000 times more sensitive to a man's salary than the other way around when it comes to rating attractiveness [(Wang et al., 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109051381730315X).
