## Social Factors

### Mental Illness

Strong genetic selection exists against schizophrenia, autism, and anorexia nervosa [(Power et al., 2013)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/1390257), and there appears to be genetic selection for ADHD [(Rokeach & Wiener, 2014;](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1087054714538660)  [Ostergaard et al., 2017)](https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(17)30205-8/fulltext).

Tinder users tend to be higher on dark triad traits and sociosexuality, and those with higher dark triad traits and sociosexuality are more motivated to use Tinder for short-term mating [(Sevi, 2019)](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1614-0001/a000297).

[McDonald et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886911005708) found that there are two distinct factors of dark triad life history strategies. First is a fast life strategy factor that includes the impulsive antisociality facet of psychopathy, the entitlement/exploitativeness facet of narcissism, machiavellianism, unrestricted sociosexuality, and aggression. Second is a slow life strategy factor that includes the fearless dominance facet of psychopathy and the leadership/authority and grandiose exhibitionism facets of narcissism.

[Davis et al. (2018)](https://evolutionlab.nipissingu.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2019/09/Davis2019_Article_TheRelationsBetweenLifeHistory.pdf) found that narcissism predicted a slow strategy, while psychopathy and status-driven risk taking predicted a fast strategy. Machiavellianism and everyday sadism were not predictors of life history strategy.

Dark triad personalities are significantly more attractive to women [(Carter et al., 2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273809664_The_Dark_Triad_personality_Attractiveness_to_women).

Personality factors most strongly linked to susceptibility to infidelity are low Conscientiousness, high Narcissism, and high Psychoticism [(Buss & Shackelford, 1997)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656697921759?via%3Dihub).

### Intelligence and Personality

Individuals at the upper and lower ends of the intelligence distribution are less likely to have sex [(Halpern et al., 2000)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10706169/).

The only personality trait that affects physical attractiveness is extraversion, which has a positive effect [(Anderson et al., 2001)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.81.1.116).

Men tend to prefer niceness in women, but women do not prefer niceness in men [(Birnbaum et al., 2014)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167214543879). Happiness is the most attractive female emotion expression, and one of the least attractive in males [(Tracy et al., 2011)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0022902).

### Bullying

Intrasexual competition comprises both competitor derogation and self-promotion. Bullying can be seen as a form of intrasexual competition in that it involves competitor derogation. This is consistent with evidence suggesting that male and female adolescent bullies are engaging in or cognizing about self-promotion strategies to improve physical appearance as well. Bullied adolescents are also concerned with appearance but mostly due to reduced self-esteem, body-esteem, and emotional problems from getting bullied [(Lee, 2017)](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/90332/). Bullying behavior predicts an increase in sexual opportunities [(Volk et al., 2015;](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704915613909)  [Provenzano et al., 2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321812090_Do_Bullies_Have_More_Sex_The_Role_of_Personality).

### Status and Wealth

Male status has a positive effect on reproductive success [(Rueden & Jaeggi, 2016)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1606800113). However, only high status men and not high status women are seen as more attractive [(DeWall & Maner, 2008)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/147470490800600209).

High-income men have more biological children than do low-income men and high-income women. However, intelligence decreases the number of offspring and frequency of sex for both men and women [(Hopcroft, 2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513805000619?via%3Dihub).

Greater income does not buy more sex, nor more sexual partners [(Blanchflower & Oswald, 2004)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170109063039/https://www.nber.org/papers/w10499). However, while men tend not to care about income in online dating, women do [(Ong & Wang, 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268114003242). Women are 1000 times more sensitive to a man's salary than the other way around when it comes to rating attractiveness [(Wang et al., 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109051381730315X).

## Physical Factors

### Health

Physiological measures of health such as immune function, oxidative stress and semen quality do not appear to be strongly related to mating success [(Foo et al., 2017)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.160603). Only female waist-to-hip ratio and weight appear to predict both attractiveness and health. Attractiveness has an overall relationship with health among women, but male attractiveness does not appear to be related to male health [(Weeden & Sabini, 2005)](http://femininebeauty.info/f/weeden.sabini.pdf).

### Shoulder-Hip-Waist Ratios

Men with higher shoulder to hip ratios and women with low waist to hip ratios have sexual intercourse at an earlier age, more sexual partners, more extrapair copulations, and having themselves been extrapair copulation partners [(Hughes & Gallup, 2003)](https://www.psy.uq.edu.au/~uqbziets/Hughes2003%20-%20Shoulder%20to%20hip%20ratio.pdf). A low waist-hip ratio is viewed cross-culturally as attractive [(Singh et al., 2010)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-07977-002). Even blind men prefer a low waist-top-hip ratio [(Karremans et al., 2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513809001093?via%3Dihub).

### Facial Morphology

Facial width-to-height ratio is positively associated with aggression [(Haselhuhn et al., 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4388848/), psychopathic traits [(Anderl et al., 2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886915005759), and achievement drive [(Lewis et al., 2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886912000049). Those with a higher facial width-to-height ratio tend to achieve higher social status [(Hahn et al., 2017)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8986/4ab104a36c75ee30d825900d6a31a582c693.pdf).

Facial width was also related to attractiveness to women for short-term but not long-term relationships [(Valentine et al., 2014)](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2727&context=soss_research). Facially dominant looking boys are more likely to report coital opportunity than facially submissive looking boys [(Mazur et al., 1994)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-44767-001).

### Body Attractiveness

Upper body strength is the primary determinant of male body attractiveness, along with tallness and leanness [(Sell et al., 2017)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.1819#d3e552). Across cultures, there is an inverse linear relationship between physically attractiveness and body fatness or BMI [(Wang et al., 2015)](https://peerj.com/articles/1155/).

### Height

There is a strong inverse association between height and suicide [(Magnusson et al., 2005)](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373).

Male tallness is directionally selected for [(Mueller & Mazur, 2001)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002650100370). Women prefer on average a larger height difference between themselves and their partner than men do. Women are most satisfied when their partner is 21 cm taller, while men are most satisfied when they are 8cm taller than their partner [(Stulp et al., 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913000020).

Height in men is negatively associated with intrasexual competitiveness [(Polo et al., 2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1474704917749172). Intrasexual competition is positively correlated with height over-report [(Mailhos et al., 2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886917302003?via%3Dihub).

Short children are more likely to be bullied than their taller peers [(Voss & Mulligan, 2000)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC32258/pdf/612.pdf).

### Voice Pitch

Individuals with lower-pitched voices are more likely to win elected office but are not actually better leaders [(Klofstad & Anderson, 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513817301770?via%3Dihub). CEOs with deeper voices manage larger companies and thus make more money [(Mayew et al., 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513813000238). Lower-pitched voices are perceived by women to be more attractive and to signify a higher socioeconomic status [(O'Connor et al., 2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109051381400052X?via%3Dihub). Low male voice pitch is preferred mainly in short-term mating contexts rather than in long-term committed ones, and this is greatest when women are in the fertile phase of their ovulatory cycles. Lower male voice pitch correlated with higher self-reported mating success [(Puts, 2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513805000176). Lower voice pitch being preferred mainly in short-term mating contexts is mediated by the relation between voice pitch and perceived infidelity by females [(O'Connor et al., 2014b)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913012324?via%3Dihub). While male voice pitch but not female voice pitch is related to reproductive outcomes, voice pitch in men does not predict child morality [(Apicella et al., 2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2391230/).

### Facial Shape

Across cultures, facial averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphism are attractive in both male and female faces [(Rhodes, 2006)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16318594/). This suggests that there exists some good candidates for biologically based standards of beauty.

## Sperm Count

Across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, there has been a 50-60% decline in sperm counts between 1973 and 2011 [(Levine et al., 2017)](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689?login=false).

## Race

Men of all races tend to rate Asian women as being relatively attractive and black women as being relatively unattractive, although tend to also be biased in favor of their own race. Numbers are mixed for white women and latina women. Women tend to rate their own race as being the most attractive [(Rudder, 2014)](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/raceandattraction20092014.html).

Europeans living in countries with a large foreign-born population have an increased preference for minority groups [(Potarca & Mills, 2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271837870_Racial_Preferences_in_Online_Dating_across_European_Countries).

## Beauty

There is interrater reliability in terms of who people find is and is not attractive both within and across cultures. Moreover, attractive children and adults are judged and treated more positively than unattractive children and adults, even by those who know them, and attractive children and adults exhibit more positive behaviors and traits [(Langlois et al., 2000)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825783/). People assessed as more physically attractive at age 15 had higher socioeconomic status at age 36 and were more likely to be married, even after controlling for other factors [(Benzeval et al., 2013)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063975).

## Asking Out

Men tend to prefer to ask out women and ask out women more. On the other hand, women tend to prefer to be asked out and ask out men less. This has not changed in spite of great changes in gender relations over the past few decades. This may be because women evolutionarily want to demonstrate sexual fidelity to attract an ideal partner [(Mills, 2011)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-how-and-why-sex-differences/201104/why-dont-women-ask-men-out-first-dates).
