## Child Labor

Historically, bans on child labor have not been the primary reason for declines in child labor, but rather improvements in industrialization and economic growth which brought rising incomes which allowed parents to keep their children out of the workforce [(Edmonds, 2005;](https://sci-hub.st/10.3368/jhr.XL.1.77)  [Whaples, 2005)](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/child-labor-in-the-united-states/). Research in fact suggests that in the case of India's Child Labor Ban, the relative probability of child employment increased and child wages relative to adult wages decreased after the ban, as well as decreased young child participation in schooling [(Bharadwaj et al., 2019)](https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jeea/jvz059). This is consistent with the idea that families use child labor to satisfy basic subsistence needs, which don't go away simply due to a ban on child labor. Similar results have been found in Bangladesh following the 1993 United States Child Labor Deterrence Act [(Powell, 2014)](https://www.cato.org/economic-development-bulletin/case-against-child-labor-prohibitions).

## Sweatshops and Worker Quality of Life

While sweatshops are commonly said to be unjust due to their poor labor conditions, when examining the evidence one should compare how the presence of sweatshops in **already poverished countries** affects the workers who work in them as well as the broader domestic eocnomy. Research suggests that multinational firms, the firms which have sweatshop jobs, pay more than domestic firms in third world countries and that sweatshop jobs provide workers with above average living standards [(Powell & Skarbek, 2006)](http://hseuenglish102.pbworks.com/f/JobsworththeSweat.pdf). Foreign ownership of firms raises wages by expanding labor production and the scale of production, improving the conditions of work in the process. Not only that, but foreign-owned firms in fact make use of labor organizations and democratic institutions [(Brown et al., 2004)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c9541/c9541.pdf#page=45). While child labor occurs, the vast majority of child laborers of sweatshops and carpet factories are members of landless, very poor families, making it an economic necessity, especially in single mother families where it may be the only source of income. These are situations where children lack access to education regardless of whether they work in sweatshops or not due to them needing to work to sustain their families, regardless of the type of work [(Banerjee, 2018)](https://www.cips-cepi.ca/2018/02/26/the-ethics-of-buying-clothes-produced-in-sweatshops/). All of this helps to explain why workers subjectively perceive factor employment to provide more stable compensation [(Skarbek et al., 2012)](https://0x0.la/u/F6CEuq4.pdf).
