There are two major types of stereotypes which are of concern when discussing stereotype accuracy. Generic stereotypes are those which make an assertion about every member of a group. On the other hand, statistical stereotypes are those which make an assertion about group averages. Research suggests that statistical stereotypes are generally accurate and group differences are often underestimated, and have been found across race and gender lines [(Jussim et al., 2016)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-19097-002). Some statistical stereotypes are nonetheless exaggerated, such as stereotypes about adherents to political ideologies or stereotypes about national character.

There are several moderators to this effect. More educated people tend to at least hold more accurate racial stereotypes, people with a multicultural mindset tend to have more accurate stereotypes than those with a colorblind mindset, and people who are left-wing, regardless of intelligence level, tend to hold less accurate stereotypes [(Jussim et al., 2016)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-19097-002).

Inaccurate statistical stereotypes about political differences, which were exaggerated, is a major predictor of the likelihood of one to engage in political action [(Jussim et al., 2016)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-19097-002). This may be a notable cause of political divides today.

Importantly, however, generic stereotypes tend to predominate the decision-making of individuals, and these tend to be cognitively simpler, are often about infrequent attributes, are based on limited statistical evidence, are not very prone to change, and are often used to generate genetic explanations where they may not necessarily exist [(Bian & Cimpian, 2017;] [Hammond & Cimpian, 2017)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313670518_Investigating_the_cognitive_structure_of_stereotypes_Generic_beliefs_about_groups_predict_social_judgments_better_than_statistical_beliefs). Therefore, it is fair to suggest that generic stereotypes are inaccurate, while statistical stereotypes are. Because generic stereotypes are employed by people more, however, we can reasonably conclude that stereotype accuracy, at least in terms of the ways in which people process stereotypes, is low.
