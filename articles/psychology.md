## Autism

Interesting factoids about autism:

- Autistic people have particular morphological features which can strongly predict someone having autism [(Aldridge et al., 2011;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21999758/)  [Ozgen et al., 2011;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20473590/)  [Ozgen et al., 2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22669539/).

- Premature mortality is markedly increased in ASD owing to a multitude of medical conditions [(Hirvikoski et al., 2018)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/premature-mortality-in-autism-spectrum-disorder/4C9260DB64DFC29AF945D32D1C15E8F2).

- Neurotypical peers are less willing to interact with autistic people based on thin slice judgments. These do not change with increased exposure and occur across both children and adults [(Sasson et al., 2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40700#discussion). However, these biases disappear when impressions are based on conversational content lacking audio-visual cues. This suggests that style and not substance drives negative impressions of autistic people.

- Children with autism have significantly higher levels of suicidal ideation and higher rates of suicide attempts [(Mayes et al., 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1750946712000931).

- Autism is highly heritable [(Freitag, 2006)](https://www.nature.com/articles/4001896).

- People with autism display facial expressions less frequently, for a less amount of time, and are less likely to share facial expressions with others or mimic expressions. Their facial expressions are also lower in quality and less accurately judged. However, people with ASD do not express emotions less intensely nor is their reaction time slower in response to stimuli [(Trevisan et al., 2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2037).

- People with ASD, primarily males, have more hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies [(Schöttle et al., 2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789215/).

- Individuals with ASD are less able to understand and infer other people's beliefs, intentions, and feelings, less likely to respond to the specific emotions of people in pain, less cognitively aware of the belief in, intention of and feeling for others, and have less immediate response to the special emotions of people in pain. People with ASD are as likely to immediately share and resonate with the emotions of other people, and are more likely to share or become affectively congruent with others' emotional states [(Song et al., 2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6794557/).

## Heritability

Heritability is a very misleading concept for several reasons. It is often assumed to be the amount of a trait that is due to genetics, but there is no measure of this. There are several limitations to the notion of heritability [(Moore & Shenk, 2016)](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1400):

- First, heritability looks at the proportion of population variance in a trait that can be explained by population differences in genetics. This means that heritability estimates can be very different for the same trait depending on the population examined. For example, in the case of a population with very little environmental variation, you will have a significantly higher heritability estimate for a trait compared with a population with very high environmental variation.

- Second, given that all traits are filtered through genetics, it is impossible to actually separate out genetic from environmental effects. Genes turn on and respond in various ways depending on the environment, so the strict separation between genetic and environmental influences is highly dubious.

- Third, twin studies which are the hallmark of heritability estimates assume that identical twins have no more similar environments than fraternal twins, and thus attribute all differences between groups to genetics. However, identical twins are exposed to demonstrably similar environments than are fraternal twins, starting in the womb. Identical twins often share a placenta while fraternal twins always have two separate placentas. Identical twins that share a placenta have more similar IQs and personalities than identical twins who do not share a placenta. This effect however appears to be small and only limited to a few phenotypes [(Beijsterveldt et al., 2015)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-015-9745-3). More significantly, it is likely that identical twins will be treated in social interactions more similarly than fraternal twins, increasing the similarity of their environments further. This has been shown to undermine research finding a strong heritability for schizophrenia, as identical twins have a smaller differences in their level of bullying, sexual abuse, physical maltreatment, emotional neglect and abuse, and general trauma compared to fraternal twins [(Fosse et al., 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25972816/). Only some of those traits could be reasonably suggested to be genetic. This is consistent with research suggesting that the equal environments assumption is not strictly valid for most outcomes, with a likely modest bias [(Scarr, 1968;](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1080/19485565.1968.9987750) [Felson, 2014)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.10.004).

**Misc**

[(McGue et al., 2007)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-007-9142-7)

- Differing variances in SES and parent disinhibatory psychopathology do not appear to significantly affect adoptive-sibling correlations for delinquency, drug use, and IQ, suggesting that adoption studies can be used to obtain direct heritability estimates.

## Intelligence

### IQ and Crime

Research suggests that intelligence is correlated with crime, most research suggesting independently of socio-economics status [(Erickson, 1929;](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2123&context=jclc) [Gendreau et al., 1996;](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1996.tb01220.x) [Levine, 2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886911000912). This predictive validity of IQ persists in cross-state comparisons [(Bartels et al., 2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886909005169). This relationship, however, is not perfectly linear. People who have very low intelligence have slightly lower criminality than people with fairly low intelligence, and people with very high intelligence have slightly higher criminality than people with fairly high intelligence [(Schwartz et al., 2015;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961500077X) [Oleson, 2017)](https://clcjbooks.rutgers.edu/books/criminal-genius-a-portrait-of-high-iq-offenders/).

### IQ and Individual Income/Wealth

There is a relationship between an individual’s intelligence level and their future income. People with higher intelligence levels tend to have higher incomes [(Irwing & Lynn, 2006;](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d6fdb1364dc3e73c44441ba55a15f1b9bc49265a) [Wolfinger, 2019)](https://ifstudies.org/blog/can-intelligence-predict-income). Importantly, however, this relationship does not appear to translate perfectly in terms of total wealth. While intelligence predicts higher income, it has a quadratic relationship with financial distress [(Zagorsky, 2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289607000219). Therefore, it is not entirely clear how much net wealth is affected by intelligence.

### IQ and Educational Attainment

Intelligence is a major predictor of school achievements, partially through more intelligent people having higher levels of motivation to succeed in school environments [(Roth et al., 2015;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289615001269) [Kriegbaum et al., 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X18300691).

### Heritability of Intelligence

Intelligence is highly heritable at as high as 0.8 [(Sauce & Matzel, 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5754247/).

There are a very high number of genetic loci which have been found to be associated with intelligence [(Sniekers et al., 2017;](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3869)  [Davies et al., 2018;](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04362-x?ref=iqpredictionnews)  [Huguet et al., 2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024554v3.full.pdf).

High intelligence is also familial, heritable, and caused by the same genetic and environmental factors responsible for the normal distribution of intelligence [(Shakeshaft et al., 2015)](https://files.catbox.moe/xd769q.pdf). Additionally, intellectual disability is heritable at 51% [(Lichtenstein et al., 2021)](https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13560).

Similarly, educational attainment is reasonably heritable [(Silventoinen et al., 2020;](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69526-6)  [Wolfram & Morris, 2023)](https://files.catbox.moe/3t8uvr.pdf).

### Adoption and IQ

Adopted siblings or peers have higher IQ scores than their nonadopted siblings or peers who stayed behind [(Ijzendoorn et al., 2005)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15740423/). These effects are not g-loaded [(Nijenhuis et al., 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886914005248).

### Lead and IQ

There is an inverse relationship between blood lead concentration and IQ and reading test scores [(Lanphear et al., 2005;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257652/)  [Aizer et al., 2016)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22558/w22558.pdf). These effects are g loaded [(Woodley et al., 2019)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.09.005).

### Emotional Intelligence

Emotional intelligence can be reduced to g, personality trait agreeableness, and sex [(Schulte et al., 2004)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2003.11.014).

### Multiple Intelligences

Highly diverse tests of purely cognitive abilities are strongly g-loaded, suggesting that multiple intelligences do not exist [(Visser et al., 2006)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.02.004).

### Knowledge Retention

Across a variety of fields, students lose a large percentage of the knowledge they receive in a course within the first two years following completion [(Kohen & Kipps, 1979;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.2307/1182376)  [Bacon & Stewart, 2006;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/0273475306291463)  [D'eon, 2006;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6920-6-5)  [Custers, 2010)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10459-008-9101-y).

### Test Anxiety

Test anxiety does not induce measurement bias in aptitude and cognitive ability test scores [(Reeve & Bonnacio, 2008;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2007.11.003)  [Sommer & Arendasy, 2015;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.08.007)  [Sommer & Arendasy, 2016)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2016.06.030). Rather, test anxiety is most closely related to psychometric g [(Sommer & Arendasy, 2014)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2013.11.003).

### IQ and Health

Higher intelligence is associated with a substantially lower risk of death, even after adjusting for childhood and adult socioeconomic status as well as education, although adult SES and education attenuate it substantially [(Calvin et al., 2010)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyq190). Research suggests that this effect is mostly genetic in origin [(Arden et al., 2015)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyv112).

### IQ Testing Bias

IQ test-retest score gains are correlated with g loadings at -1, meaning that score gains are not g-loaded at all [(Nijenhuis et al., 2006;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.07.006)  [Sala & Gobet, 2018)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2018.10.004).

### Wilson Effect

The heritability of IQ increases with age, reaching a maximum of about 0.6-0.8 (Bouchard, 2013; Briley & Drob, 2013).

### G Factor

Rats display a general factor of intelligence [(Anderson, 1993)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8510832/), as well as dogs [(Arden & Adams, 2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961630023X).

The there exists a general intelligence, or g factor, which is highly heritable [(Toga & Thompson, 2005;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15651931/)  [Panizzon et al., 2014)](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0160289614000099). General cognitive ability can predict academic performance, career potential, creativity, and job performance [(Kuncel et al., 2004)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.148).

This general factor has been shown to also exist in international cognitive ability comparisons [(Rindermann, 2007)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.634).

There is expert consensus that g is an important non-trivial predictor or determinant of important real world outcomes, and that g tests are valid and generally do not have racial bias [(Reeve & Charles, 2008)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2008.03.007).

### IQ and Fertility

There is a small negative correlation between cognitive ability and fertility among modern humans [(Reeve et al., 2018)](https://www.gwern.net/docs/genetics/selection/dysgenics/2018-reeve.pdf). There is strong assortative mating for intelligence [(Escorial & Buro, 2012)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.5209/rev_SJOP.2012.v15.n2.38879).

### Predictive Validity

In higher ability populations, cognitive ability tests are less correlated with one another and less g loaded [(Blum & Holling, 2017)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2017.07.004).

There is a small negative relationship between IQ and rearrest [(Schwartz & Beaver, 2019)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336572503_A_longitudinal_examination_of_the_association_between_intelligence_and_rearrest_using_a_latent_trait-state-occasion_modeling_approach_in_a_sample_of_previously_adjudicated_youth).

There is a small and heterogeneous positive correlation between IQ and creativity [(Kim, 2005)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.4219/jsge-2005-473).

Estimates of IQ across states and counties have shown to be negatively correlated with crime [(Bartels et al., 2010;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886909005169)  [Beaver & Wright, 2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289610001340).

A 1 point increase in a nation's average IQ is associated with a persistent 0.11% annual increase in per-capita GDP [(Jones & Schneider, 2006)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-006-7407-2). IQ is also associated with the production and exportation of more sophisticated/complex products [(Lapatinas & Litina, 2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-018-1511-y).

Education and cognitive ability appear to be more important as developmental factors for GDP than economic freedom. Education and intelligence are more relevant to economic welfare than vice versa, but economic welfare also predicts education and intelligence [(Rindermann, 2008)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289607000207).

IQ is a significant predictor of financial development [(Hafer, 2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289615001877).

National IQ is positively correlated with economic development, and is the best predictor of economic growth [(Lynn & Vanhanen, 2001;](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279641226_National_IQ_and_Economic_Development_A_Study_of_Eighty-One_Nations)  [Kirkegaard, 2022)](https://files.catbox.moe/eu2qiv.pdf).

National IQ is correlated with a variety of educational, cognitive, economic, political, demographic, sociological, geographic, and climate variables [(Lynn & Vanhanen, 2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289611001413).

### Brain Size/Chemistry and IQ

Brain size is positively associated with g [(McDaniel, 2005;](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mamcdani/Big-Brained%20article.pdf)  [Rushton & Ankney, 2009;](https://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Whole-Brain-Size-and-General-Mental-Ability-A-Review-2009-by-John-Philippe-Rushton-C.-Davison-Ankney.pdf)  [Pietschnig et al., 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26449760/). This is of genetic origin as whole-brain gray and white matter is highly heritable [(Posthuma et al., 2002)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1038/nn0202-83), and there is a genetic correlation between intracranial volume and years of education [(Lee et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289618301703), as well as intelligence [(Jansen et al., 2020)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345345210_Genome-wide_meta-analysis_of_brain_volume_identifies_genomic_loci_and_genes_shared_with_intelligence).

Human intelligence can be predicted with some accuracy using neuroimaging techniques [(Dubois et al., 2018;](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325892393_A_distributed_brain_network_predicts_general_intelligence_from_resting-state_human_neuroimaging_data)  [Vieira et al., 2021)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355466374_On_the_prediction_of_human_intelligence_from_neuroimaging_A_systematic_review_of_methods_and_reporting).

### Misc

General cognitive ability is associated with a lower inclination to believe various conspiracies and paranormal phenomena, but only among individuals who strongly value epistemic rationality [(Stahl & Prooijen, 2018)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2017.10.026).

Reaction time tasks correlate with psychometric intelligence [(Jensen & Whang, 2008)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/abs/reaction-times-and-intelligence-a-comparison-of-chineseamerican-and-angloamerican-children/BD88A84A4E84CEF28EE2242F45D85555).

## Personality

Neuroticism is the strongest predictor of life satisfaction, happiness, and negative affect. Positive affect is predicted equally well by extraversion and agreeableness [(DeNeve & Cooper, 1998)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197).

Academic performance correlates significantly with agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness. Correlations between conscientiousness and academic performance were largely independent of intelligence. Conscientiousness is as strong of a predictor of tertiary academic performance as intelligence, after controlling for secondary academic performance [(Poropat, 2009)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/a0014996).

## Political Orientation

### Ideology and Cognition

Right-wingers tend to have lower openness and higher conscientiousness compared to left-wingers. There is also some evidence suggesting right-wingers also tend to have lower neuroticism and agreeableness, and higher extraversion [(Sibley et al., 2012;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656612001158?via%3Dihub) [Phillips, 2021)](https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=tdr). The correlation between personality traits and political orientation is a function of an innate common genetic factor, as opposed to being causal in one direction or another [(Verhulst et al., 2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3809096/#:~:text=The%20results%20suggest%20that%20personality,innate%20common%20underlying%20genetic%20factor). Conservatives and liberals also have equal levels of narcissism, although they differ in the ways in which narcissists of each orientation tend to express their narcissism, where conservatives are more entitled and liberals are more exhibitionistic [(Hatemi & Fazekas, 2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12380).

A unidimensional model of ideology is incomplete when studying political ideology, as economic and social views have different determinants, suggesting that a model of ideology should have at least two dimensions to it [(Feldman & Johnston, 2013)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12055).

Needs for security and certainty generally yield culturally conservative but economically left-wing values [(Malka et al., 2014)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0036170). Death anxiety, system instability, dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity, needs for order, structure, and closure, and fear of threat and loss all positively predict political conservatism, while uncertainty tolerance, integrative complexity, and self-esteem negatively predict political conservatism [(Jost et al., 2003)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-00782-003). Emotional abilities are significantly and negatively related to socio-cultural and economic-hierarchical right-wing attitudes, as well as to blatant ethnic prejudice [(Van Hiel et al., 2019)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-41368-001).

The brains of right-wingers/conservatives tend to be more reactive to fear, aversive stimuli, sudden noises, and threatening visual images [(Oxley et al., 2008;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18801995/) [Kanai et al., 2011;](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(11)00289-2) [Dodd et al., 2012)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2011.0268#aff-1).

### Ideology and Intelligence

Libertarians (economically right-wing, socially left-wing) tend to be the most intelligent [(Iyer et al., 2012;](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042366) [Carl, 2014;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289614000373) [Caplan, 2015;](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/01/intelligence_ma_1.html) [Kirkegaard et al., 2017;](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emil-O-W-Kirkegaard/publication/313890514_Cognitive_Ability_and_Political_Preferences_in_Denmark/links/58adc44b92851cf7ae85ac79/Cognitive-Ability-and-Political-Preferences-in-Denmark.pdf) [Carl, 2018;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289618300667) [Jedinger, 2021)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211046808), followed by liberals (economically and socially left-wing) and then conservatives (economically and socially right-wing) [(Onraet et al., 2015)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.2027). This appears to be due to beliefs in personal and economic liberalism both being correlated with intelligence.

However, this effect varies across cultures [(Rindermann et al., 2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611001425), and there is evidence to suggest that a lot of the relationship between ideology and intelligence is a function of which beliefs are mainstream, with mainstream beliefs being associated with higher intelligence [(McGreal, 2013)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/unique-everybody-else/201305/intelligence-and-politics-have-complex-relationship). More intelligent people tend to be more ideologically intolerant [(Ganzach & Schul, 2021)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-55298-001). Belief superiority is better predicted by extremity of political beliefs than by partisan affiliation [(Toner et al., 2013)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-44136-012). Conservatives tend to be more ideologically intolerant than liberals, and extreme ideologists tend to be more ideologically intolerant than moderate ideologists [(Ganzach & Schul, 2021)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-55298-001). Greater political knowledge is associated with affective polarization [(Suk et al., 2021)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/20570473211063237).

Intelligence is also associated with thinking more like economists, who tend to among other things, trust market mechanisms [(Caplan & Miller, 2010)](https://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/pdfs/intelligencethinklike.pdf).

### Ideology and Well-Being

Conservatives tend to be happier [(Wojcik et al., 2015)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260817), have more meaning in life [(Newman et al., 2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550618768241), have better mental health [(Newport, 2007;](https://news.gallup.com/poll/102943/republicans-report-much-better-mental-health-than-others.aspx) [Kirkegaard, 2020)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339541044_Mental_illness_and_the_left), and are physically healthier [(Subramanian & Perkins, 2010;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2912481/) [Chan et al., 2019)](http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886919300054). These effects are due to a number of causes, most notably a belief in personal agency being a cause of the happiness and health effects [(Schlenker et al., 2012)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2011.12.009).

Interestingly, while conservatives tend to have better mental health than liberals, suicide rates tend to be higher in places that are more conservative or are run by more conservative governments [(Blakely & Collings, 2002;](https://jech.bmj.com/content/56/10/722) [Warraich et al., 2022)](https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj-2021-069308).

Those who engage in more traditional sexual behaviors tend to be more socially conservative, while those who engage in more masturbation, risky sex, and casual sex, tend to be more liberal. Despite the narrower band of activities that conservatives engage in, those with more conservative orientations tend to be more satisfied with their sex life [(Hatemi et al., 2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916310364).

Conservatives generally have more kids and have them earlier, as well as being more likely to be married. These gaps have gotten larger over time [(Stone, 2020)](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-conservative-fertility-advantage). One potential factor playing into this is that after women have children, they tend to adopt more conservative social attitudes around gender roles [(Kuziemko et al., 2018)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24740).

States that become more politically liberal tend to have increases in their demand for alcohol, with consumption of beer and spirits rising and consumption of wine potentially falling [(Yakovlev & Guessford, 2013)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-wine-economics/article/abs/alcohol-consumption-and-political-ideology-whats-party-got-to-do-with-it/D7191B2F1C4F11D9527AFA6F06614912).

### Ideology and Physical Appearance

Right-wingers tend to be more attractive than left-wingers [(Berggren et al., 2017;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.12.008) [Peterson & Palmer, 2017)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1017/pls.2017.18), partially due to attractive people being more likely to support inequality [(Belmi & Neale, 2014)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.03.002), as they earn more. Appearance is a substantial predictor of political ideology, as facial recognition technology can correctly identify political orientation in liberal-conservative face pairs significantly greater than at random [(Kosinski, 2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801376/).

### Heritability of Political Views

Political views appear to be roughly 40% heritable [(Hatemi et al., 2014)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-014-9648-8), if not more [(Pew, 2013;](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/12/09/study-on-twins-suggests-our-political-beliefs-may-be-hard-wired/). This varies heavily with political sophistication, with people high in political sophistication having an estimated heritability of political views of 74% [Kalmoe & Johnson, 2021)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/genes-ideology-and-sophistication/91C7C343BBA8801732F62E7D55B16676). There is significant genetic overlap between political views and a variety of psychological traits, such as cognitive ability and personality [(Dawes & Weinschenk, 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154620300553), suggesting that much of these beliefs are byproducts of indirectly related psychological characteristics.

### Ideology and Cognitive Bias

Both conservatives and liberals have motivated disbelief in political problems when averse to the solutions of such problems, such as conservatives not believing in climate change [(Campbell & Kay, 2014)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25347128/). [Ditto et al. (2019)](https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/faculty.sites.uci.edu/dist/c/602/files/2019/08/Ditto-et-al.-2018-Perspectives-on-Psychological-Science-paper.pdf) meta-analyzed the results of 51 experimental studies and found that liberals and conservatives had the same level of tendency to evaluate otherwise identical information more favorably when it supports one's political beliefs or allegiances than when it challenges those beliefs or allegiances. People perceive the world in a manner consistent with their political views, meaning there is a selective pattern of learning in which partisans have higher levels of knowledge for facts that confirm their worldview and lower levels of knowledge for facts that challenge them [(Jerit & Barabas, 2012)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381612000187).

Liberals tend to be better at identifying flawed arguments supporting conservative beliefs while conservatives tend to be better at identifying flawed arguments supporting liberal beliefs [(Gampa et al., 2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550619829059). Conservatives and liberals have similar levels of desires to remain in their respective ideological bubbles [(Frimer et al., 2017)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2953780).

Both liberals and conservatives find Stephen Colbert funny, but conservatives are more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely means what he says while liberals are more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements. Conservatism also significantly predicted perceptions that Colbert disliked liberalism [(LaMarre et al., 2009)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1940161208330904).

### Ideology and Morality

Conservatives are significantly more charitable than liberals [(Yang & Liu, 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X21000752). Liberals self-report more criminal conduct than do conservatives [(Wright et al., 2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886916310996?via%3Dihub). Political and religious conservatism are both inversely related to child abuse rates, although only the religious conservatism effect remained after controlling for population density [(Brayer & MacPhee, 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213414004074).

Liberals tend to express compassion toward less structured and more encompassing entities, supporting universalism, while conservatives express compassion toward more well-defined and less encompassing entities, supporting parochialism [(Waytz et al., 2019)](https://files.catbox.moe/kafw6v.pdf). In other words, liberals tend to support an expansion of the moral circle. Higher perceptions of social dangers and greater emphases on the binding moral foundations relative to the individualizing foundations is associated with conservatism [(Van Leeuwen & Park, 2009)](http://timbates.wdfiles.com/local--files/group-project/Leuwen%20and%20Park.pdf). Liberals have greater endorsement of the harm/care and fairness/reciprocity foundations compared to the other 3 foundations, while conservatives endorse and use the 5 foundations more equally [(Graham et al., 2009)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-05192-002).

Genetic attributions are more likely to be made by liberals, are associated with higher and not lower levels of tolerance of vulnerable individuals, and are unrelated with unseemly racial attitudes [(Schneider et al., 2018)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/696860). Both conservative economic and social political ideology indirectly predict homophobia through binding foundations [(Barnett et al., 2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28466228/#:~:text=Study%202%20found%20that%20both,between%20political%20ideology%20and%20homophobia). Compared to conservatives, moderates and liberals are much less accepting of discriminatory actions. Conservatives tend to value employers' decision rights while others value utilitarian concerns [(Kuhn & Osaki, 2023)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w30236#fromrss).

### Age and Ideology

Older Americans tend to be more conservative [(Pew, 2014)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/), and this is due to the effect of ageing increasing one's likelihood of being conservative [(Tilley & Evans, 2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379413000875).

### Miscellaneous

Consistent liberals and consistent conservatives are the people most likely to engage in activism and the political process [(Pew, 2014)](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/section-5-political-engagement-and-activism/).

White liberals but not white conservatives present less competence to black interaction partners than white ones, suggesting that well-intentioned liberal whites may draw on low-status/competence stereotypes to affiliate with minorities [(Dupree & Fiske, 2018)](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/pv2ab).

Stereotypes and perceptions about activists reduce people's willingness to affiliate with activists and to adopt the behaviors these activists promote [(Bashir et al., 2013)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-42785-004).

Individuals tend to conform to the group's opinion or censor their views in situations where people deliberately disagree with them. Conformity and censorship are most frequent among introverted, emotionally stable, and racial minority participants [(Feenstra, 2014)](https://scholarworks.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&context=honorstheses).

Ignorance of policy-specific information leads many to hold political views they wouldn't hold otherwise. This effect is greatest for those with the highest levels of political knowledge [(Gilens, 2005)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/political-ignorance-and-collective-policy-preferences/D4E790DE0197D8430A03D9B8993F199B).

Individuals with dark triad traits (narcissism, machivaellianism, and psychopathy) more frequently signal virtuous victimhood, even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables that are more commonly associated with victimhood. Victim signalling is associated with amoral manipulation and a narcissism of one's belief in their superior prosociality, and also predicts a person's willingness to engage in and endorse many ethically questionable behaviors, such as lying to earn a bonus [(Ok et al., 2020)](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ok-et-al.-2020.pdf).

Right-wing authoritarianism and left-wing authoritarianism are separate constructs that reflect a shared constellation of personality traits, cognitive features, beliefs, and motivational values that are at the core of authoritarianism in general. Relative to right-wing authoriarians, left-wing authoritarians have more negative emotionality, are lower in dogmatism and cognitive rigidity, and express stronger support for state control. Left-wing authoritarianism is a strong predictor of behavioral aggression and participation in political violence [(Costello et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34383522/).

## Religious Belief

### Religiosity and Suicide

Religion overall plays a pretective role in preventing suicide [(Hilton et al., 2002;](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/155/5/413/171404) [Wu et al., 2015)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131715). This can be seen in terms of both suicide attempts and completed suicides, although religion does not reduce suicidal ideation [(Lawrence et al., 2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7310534/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20have%20found%20lower,after%20adjusting%20for%20social%20support). This may be due to religion providing access to a supportive community, shaping a person’s beliefs about suicide, providing a source of hope and providing ways to interpret suffering.

### Religiosity and Mental Health

Religiousity and spirituality is associated with better mental health [(Garssen et al., 2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508619.2020.1729570), lower depressive symptoms and less anxiety [(Coelho-Júnior et al., 2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.877213/full), as well as increased life satisfaction [(Yaden et al., 2022)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364086091_A_Meta-Analysis_of_ReligionSpirituality_and_Life_Satisfaction).

### Religiosity and Sense of Purpose

Conservative religiousity is associated with high levels of a sense of purpose in life [(Dufton, 1986)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/009164718601400105). For socially connected individuals, a religious belief in itself has minimal impact on their sense of purpose in life. However, for those who are socially disconnected, being highly religious predicted greater levels of purpose in life [(Chan et al., 2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12401). Because though religion brings people social connection in many cases, controlling for it may only tell the effect of theistic belief in sense of purpose and not the broader effect of religiousity in general. A sense of meaning in life is a crucial element of religious coping and psychological well-being [(Krok, 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4580713/).

### Religiosity and Crime

Religion is negatively associated with crime on both an individual level [(Baier & Wright, 2001)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022427801038001001#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20the%20meta,effect%20on%20individuals'%20criminal%20behavior) and a societal level [(Ellis & Peterson, 1996)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000232), as well as being negatively associated with involvement in delinquent behaviors [(Kelly et al., 2018)](https://scholarlycommons.obu.edu/articles/131/).

## Self Control

Low self-control in childhood is associated with unemployment in adulthood, even after adjusting for intelligence, social class, and gender [(Daly et al., 2015)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797615569001). It is also associated with lower social responsibility [(Mischel, 1961)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1962-04824-001), more disciplinary referrals [(Castillo et al., 2011)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v95y2011i11p1377-1385.html), in addition to differences in physical health, substance dependence, personal finances, and criminal offending outcomes [(Moffitt et al., 2011)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1010076108). Assignment to different schooling opportunities is not significantly associated with child time preferences [(Andreoni et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727271930091X).

## Suicide

Suicide is mainly associated with social isolation, such as marital status and living alone, loneliness, alienation, and belongingness [(Calati et al., 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30445391/). In terms of cross-country differences in suicide, high unemployment is positviely associated with male suicide, while income is negatively associated with male suicide up until a high threshold of income [(Neumayer, 2003)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1069397103253708).

Suicidal acts are significantly more likely to be fatal for men than for women [(Conner et al., 2019)](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-1324).

Between 1963 and 1975 the annual number of suicides in England and Wales showed a sudden and unexpected decline, inconsistent with trends in most other European countries. This appears to have been a result of the progressive removal of carbon monoxide from the public gas supply, which accounted for more than 40% of suicides in 1963. Suicide by domesic gas was essentially eliminated by 1975 [(Clarke & Mayhew, 1988)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/449144).

## Tattoos

People with tattoos tend to be rated as less attractive, more promiscuous, and more heavy drinkers based on their appearance [(Swami & Furnham, 2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18089280/). While some stereotyping may be negative in this respect, there is a degree of accuracy to negative stereotypes about tattooed people.

People with tattoos are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors [(Heywood et al., 2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22153289/), including physical violence [(Carroll et al., 2002)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12042538/), more drinking and illicit drug consumption [(Yen et al., 2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22726901/), higher suicidal ideation/attempts and depression [(Yen et al., 2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22726901/), psychiatric disorders such as antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder [(Raspa & Cusack, 1990;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2333825/)  [Wiley-Blackwell, 2008)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080715204734.htm), higher levels of psychopathy and schizophrenia [(Kim, 1991)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1781185/), higher impulsiveness, adventurism, empathy, and neuroticism [(Pozgain et al., 2004)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15119003/), and have an earlier age of first intercourse and are more sexually active [(Nowosielski et al., 2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22616886/).

Moreover, people with tattoos are more likely to have experienced childhood abuse and neglect [(Ernst et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35449026/), and score about 5 points lower on IQ tests [(Pozgain et al., 2004)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15119003/). They also appear to die earlier than those without tattoos, possibly due to health concerns but also potentially due to higher levels of risk-taking behavior [(Carson, 2014)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24926092/).

Tattoos may signify something traumatic or extreme in someone's life or may signify impulsiveness in itself.

## Trigger Warnings

Trigger warnings have no net effect on affective responses to material being warned about nor on educational outcomes [(Kimble et al., 2021;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993791/) [Bridgland et al., 2022)](https://osf.io/qav9m/). It doesn't decrease engagement with negative material but can in fact increase engagement with material [(Bridgland et al., 2022)](https://osf.io/qav9m/). Additionally, trigger warnings reinforce trauma survivor’s views of their trauma being central to their identity and increase anticipatory stress [(Jones & Bellet, 2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702620921341). This suggests that trigger warnings at best do essentially nothing and at worst have small negative effects.
