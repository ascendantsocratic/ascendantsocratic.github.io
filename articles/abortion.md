## Fetal Consciousness and Pain Perception

**Evidence Primarily suggests that the fetus does not display consciousness/pain reception until at least around 22-24 gestation weeks when the necessary parts for pain perception are established.**

[The emergence of human consciousness: from fetal to neonatal life](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19092726/)

- Fetuses do not display basic consciousness beyond programmed responses until thalamocortical connections are established, which does not happen, at least not at first, in the womb.

[The emergence of consciousness: Science and ethics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25160864/#:~:text=Assuming%20that%20consciousness%20is%20mainly,the%20sense%20organs%20are%20established)

- Fetal consciousness appears to emerge at around 24 gestational weeks, when the thalamocortical connections from the sense organs are established

[Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201429)

- Literature review
- Fetal pain probably doesn’t exist until 29 or 30 weeks
- Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections
- Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23-30 weeks gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks

## Abortion Law and Abortion Rate

**The evidence overall suggests that abortion restrictions reduce the incidence of abortion, although there is some research suggesting otherwise. Research which compares countries with different levels of abortion restrictions over a single period of time or over long periods of time suggest that abortion restrictions have no effect on the incidence of abortion. The main problem with these is that they don’t longitudinally look at changes in laws, but rather hold the laws themselves constant, ultimately hiding many of the effects that such laws could have.**

[Unintended pregnancy and abortion by income, region, and the legal status of abortion: estimates from a comprehensive model for 1990–2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X20303156)

- Finds that abortion rates increased in countries where it was restricted from 1990-2019, while it decreased in countries where it was legal.

[Abortion Worldwide 2017: Uneven Progress and Unequal Access](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/abortion-worldwide-2017.pdf)

- _“Abortions occur as frequently in the two most restrictive categories of countries (banned outright or allowed only to save the woman’s life) as in the least-restrictive category (allowed without restriction as to reason)—37 and 34 per 1,000 women, respectively.”_

**When looking at studies which look at changes in abortion laws, the research almost unanimously indicates that at least some abortion restrictions do result in lower rates of abortions. There is variation in study results depending on what type of restriction is being examined, but the most significant effects appear to be in the case of changing the number of clinics in an area, as those are significant predictors of the incidence of abortion. It is therefore likely the case that a hard ban on abortion in any area would reduce the incidence of abortion.**

[The U.S. Abortion Rate Continues to Drop: Once Again, State Abortion Restrictions Are Not the Main Driver](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2019/09/us-abortion-rate-continues-drop-once-again-state-abortion-restrictions-are-not-main)

- Between 2011 and 2017, abortion restrictions were not the main driver of the decline in the US abortion rate.
- However, abortion restrictions did play a notable role in shutting down clinics in some states thereby reducing access to abortion

[Price, Restrictions and Abortion Demand](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-007-9080-9)

- Finds that state medicaid funding is found to increase the abortion demand of women of childbearing age, while the price of an abortion, parental involvement, parental consent, and parental notification laws reduce abortion demand
- State mandatory waiting periods did not affect abortion demand

[Parental Consent for Abortion: Impact of the Massachusetts Law](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.76.4.397)

- Finds that the Massachusetts parental consent abortion law only slightly decreased abortions, but that many minors went across state lines to have abortions instead.

[The Power of Abortion Policy: Reexamining the Effects of Young Women’s Access to Reproductive Control](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/694293)

- _“Trends in sexual behavior suggest that young women’s increased access to the birth control pill fueled the sexual revolution, but neither these trends nor difference-in-difference estimates support the view that this also led to substantial changes in family formation. Rather, the estimates robustly suggest that it was liberalized access to abortion that allowed large numbers of women to delay marriage and motherhood.”_

[Abortion Incidence and Service Availability In the United States, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28094905/)

- _“In 2014, an estimated 926,200 abortions were performed in the United States, 12% fewer than in 2011; the 2014 abortion rate was 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44, representing a 14% decline over this period. The number of clinics providing abortions declined 6% between 2011 and 2014, and declines were steepest in the Midwest (22%) and the South (13%). Early medication abortions accounted for 31% of nonhospital abortions, up from 24% in 2011. Most states that experienced the largest proportionate declines in the number of clinics providing abortions had enacted one or more new restrictions during the study period, but reductions were not always associated with declines in abortion incidence.”_

[The impact of state-level restrictions on abortion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8875064/)

- _“This research examines 23 different laws passed by state governments in an effort to restrict the number of abortions. It assesses both laws passed and laws actually enforced after the Supreme Court permitted states to restrict access to abortion in 1989. None of the policy actions by state governments has had a significant impact on the incidence of abortion from 1982 to 1992. Abortion rates continue to reflect past abortion rates, the number of abortion providers, whether the state funds abortions for Medicaid-eligible women, urbanism, and racial composition of the population. Recent restrictive policies have not affected these trends.”_

[State abortion rates. The impact of policies, providers, politics, demographics, and economic environment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10164042/)

- _“Restrictions on Medicaid funding for abortion are correlated with lower abortion rates in-state and higher rates among nearby states. A maximal estimate suggests that 19-25% of the abortions among low-income women that are publicly funded do not take place after funding is eliminated. Parental notification laws for teen abortions do not significantly affect aggregate abortion rates. A larger number of abortion providers in a state increases the abortion rate, primarily through inducing cross-state travel.”_

- _“In this study, a series of regressions on a comprehensive time series cross-sectional data set provides evidence that several types of state-level anti-abortion legislation result in statistically significant declines in both the abortion rate and the abortion ratio. Furthermore, a series of natural experiments provide further evidence that abortion restrictions are correlated with reductions in the incidence of abortion.”_

[Analyzing the Impact of U.S. Antiabortion Legislation in the Post-Casey Era: A Reassessment](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532440014535477)

- _“the empirical results add to the substantial body of peer-reviewed research which finds that public funding restrictions, parental involvement laws, and properly designed informed consent laws all reduce the incidence of abortion.”_

[HOW FAR IS TOO FAR? NEW EVIDENCE ON ABORTION CLINIC CLOSURES, ACCESS, AND ABORTIONS](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23366/revisions/w23366.rev2.pdf?sy=366)

- _“We estimate the effects of abortion-clinic closures on clinic access and abortions using variation generated by Texas HB2, a “TRAP” law that shuttered nearly half of Texas' abortion clinics in late 2013. Our results suggest a substantial and non-linear effect of distance to clinics. Increases from less than 50 miles to 50-100, 100-150, and 150-200 miles reduce abortion rates by 15, 25, and 40 percent, respectively, while additional increases in distance appear to have no additional effect.”_

[The effects of economic conditions and access to reproductive health services on state abortion rates and birthrates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9099567/)

- Finds that abortion is lower in states where access to providers is reduced and state policies are restrictive
- Birth rates are elevated where costs of contraception are higher, and economic resources such as higher wages and generous welfare benefits also elevate birthrates.

## Abortion Law and Birth Rate

**The evidence on the effects of abortion restrictions on the birth rate is fairly mixed, with some research suggesting that abortion restrictions increase birth rates, and other research suggesting abortion restrictions have no effect or even increase birth rates due to decreased pregnancies.**

[Changes in Abortions and Births and the Texas Parental Notification Law](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa054047)

- _“The Texas parental notification law was associated with a decline in abortion rates among minors from 15 to 17 years of age. It was also associated with increased birth rates and rates of abortion during the second trimester among a subgroup of minors who were 17.50 to 17.74 years of age at the time of conception.”_

[The effect of Medicaid abortion funding restrictions on abortions, pregnancies and births](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10164043/#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%2012%20years,in%20births%2C%20implying%20fewer%20pregnancies)

- _“An analysis of 12 years of state-level data indicate that [medicaid abortion funding] restrictions are associated with a reduction in abortions and either no change or a reduction in births, implying fewer pregnancies.”_

**This discrepancy, however, can be solved through considering the distinction between hard restrictions (banning vs legalizing) and soft restrictions. Changing from hard restrictions to liberal abortion laws appears to drastically reduce births, which suggests that the reverse would increase births. However, modest changes in restrictions appear to have no effect on births. Therefore, it appears that hard restrictions do increase birth rates, while soft restrictions may not.**

[Abortion Policy and Fertility Outcomes: The Eastern European Experience](https://digitalcommons.dartmouth.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3361&context=facoa)

- Looks at abortion policies in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s
- Finds that countries that changed from very restrictive to liberal abortion laws experienced a large reduction in births.
- However, changes from modest restrictions to abortion available on request, led to no such change in births despite large increases in abortions, indicating that pregnancies rose in response to more liberal abortion availability.

## Abortion Law and Maternal Mortality

**Research unanimously shows that bans on abortion lead to increases in maternal mortality, which are often very large. This also appears to be the case with simple restrictions on abortion.**

[Abortion laws reform may reduce maternal mortality: an ecological study in 162 countries](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12905-018-0705-y.pdf)

- Looks at 162 countries from 1985-2013
- Finds that after adjusting for GDP capita, maternal mortality is reduced by abortion law reform in countries with restrictive abortion laws
- _“A flexibility score of abortion laws (Score 0–7) was calculated by summing the number of reasons for which abortion was legally allowed in each country.”_
- _“Compared to when a country’s flexibility score was < 3, maternal deaths were reduced by 45 per 100,000 live births (95% CI: -64, − 26) when the flexibility score increased ≥3, after adjusting for the GDP per capita and five-year time intervals.”_

[Unsafe Abortion: Unnecessary Maternal Mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/)

- _“Every year, worldwide, about 42 million women with unintended pregnancies choose abortion, and nearly half of these procedures, 20 million, are unsafe. Some 68,000 women die of unsafe abortion annually, making it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality (13%). Of the women who survive unsafe abortion, 5 million will suffer long-term health complications. Unsafe abortion is thus a pressing issue. Both of the primary methods for preventing unsafe abortion—less restrictive abortion laws and greater contraceptive use—face social, religious, and political obstacles, particularly in developing nations, where most unsafe abortions (97%) occur.”_

[Reductions in abortion-related mortality following policy reform: evidence from Romania, South Africa and Bangladesh](https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4755-8-39)

- _“As head of the ruling party in 1965, Nikolai Ceauşescu sought to reverse the decline in Romania's population growth by pursuing a rigid and brutally enforced pro-natalist policy. In 1966 and again in 1985, Ceauşescu significantly increased legal restrictions on abortion and banned modern contraceptives [18–22]. As a result, by 1989, Romania had the highest recorded maternal mortality ratio in Europe (170 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births), 87% of which were attributed to abortion complications [19, 23, 24].”_

- _“Despite a purported policy change to overturn an abortion ban in 1975, stringent restrictions perpetuated barriers to accessing safe abortion services (Act No. 72). As a result, the majority of South African women continued to terminate pregnancies through unsafe means, leading to annual unsafe abortions estimates of 120,000-250,000 during the 1975-1996 period [37–39]. By 1994, unsafe abortions had become a long-standing and significant threat to women's health in South Africa [38].”_
- _“The abortion law of 1996 was the first step towards significant reductions in unsafe abortions. The abortion care program and systematic shifts in reproductive health provision was followed by notable declines in abortion-related mortality. Figure 3 shows a decrease in abortion-related deaths in the period following the CTOP. In 1994, complications from unsafe abortion led to 32.69 deaths per 1,000 abortions. By 1998, only 0.80 deaths per 1,000 were reported and this number remained steady or dropped in subsequent years. Furthermore, as compared to 1994, there was a 91% drop in deaths related to unsafe abortion in the 1998-2001 period [58]. By the 2005-2007 period, annual abortion-related deaths accounted for only 3.3% of all maternal deaths [59].”_
- _“The current abortion law in Bangladesh is based on highly-restrictive mid-19th century British colonial laws, which only permit abortion if the life of the woman is at risk (Penal Code of India of 1860, sections 312-316). Despite the end of colonial rule, local contextual influences resulted in persistence of the abortion ban.”_
- _“However, a menstrual regulation (MR) policy was established by government independence in 1971. Defined as "an interim method to establish a case of non-pregnancy in a woman who is at risk of being pregnant", MR procedures may be performed up to 8 weeks since the last menstrual period (LMP) by a trained paramedic and up to 10 weeks by a trained physician [60, 61].”_

[Study: Banning abortion would boost maternal mortality by double-digits](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/09/08/study-banning-abortion-would-boost-maternal-mortality-double-digits)

- _“Banning abortion nationwide would lead to a 21% increase in the number of pregnancy-related deaths overall and a 33% increase among Black women, according to new CU Boulder research.”_
- _“Stevnson calculates that carrying a pregnancy to term is 33 times riskier than having an abortion. The Centers for Disease Control reports 0.41 maternal deaths per 100,000 abortions between 2013 and 2018 and to 23.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020.”_
- _“The paper does not include an estimate of increased deaths due to unsafe self-induced abortions. While expected to be low, that number may not be zero, she noted, pointing to a recent study showing about 1.5% of reproductive-age women have tried to terminate a pregnancy themselves, often using ineffective and potentially unsafe methods like herbs, drugs or objects.”_

[Study finds higher maternal mortality rates in states with more abortion restrictions](https://sph.tulane.edu/news/study-finds-higher-maternal-mortality-rates-states-more-abortion-restrictions)

- _“Using the national maternal mortality data accessed from the National Center for Health Statistics, the researchers examined the associations between the state abortion policy context in 2015 and maternal death during 2015-2018.”_
- _“The researchers found that states with the higher score of abortion policy composite index had a 7% increase in total maternal mortality compared with states with lower abortion policy composite index. Among individual abortion policies, states with a licensed physician requirement had a 51% higher total maternal mortality and a 35% higher maternal mortality (i.e. a death during pregnancy or within 42 days of being pregnant), and restrictions on state Medicaid funding for abortion was associated with a 29% higher total maternal mortality.”_
