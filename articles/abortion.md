## Fetal Consciousness and Pain Perception

Evidence Primarily suggests that the fetus does not display consciousness/pain reception until at least around 23-24 gestation weeks when the necessary parts for pain perception are established [(Lee et al., 2005;](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201429) [Lagercrantz & Changeux, 2009;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19092726/) [Lagercrantz, 2014;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25160864/#:~:text=Assuming%20that%20consciousness%20is%20mainly,the%20sense%20organs%20are%20established).

## Effects of Abortion Law

### Abortion Rate

The evidence overall suggests that abortion restrictions reduce the incidence of abortion, although there is some research suggesting otherwise. Research which compares countries with different levels of abortion restrictions over a single period of time or over long periods of time suggest that abortion restrictions have no effect on the incidence of abortion [(Bearak et al.,2010;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X20303156) [Singh et al., 2017)](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/abortion-worldwide-2017.pdf). The main problem with these is that they donâ€™t longitudinally look at changes in laws, but rather hold the laws themselves constant, ultimately hiding many of the effects that such laws could have. When looking at studies which look at changes in abortion laws, research generally indicates that at least some abortion restrictions do result in lower rates of abortions [(New, 2011;](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258188757_Analyzing_the_Effect_of_Anti-Abortion_US_State_Legislation_in_the_Post-Casey_Era) [New, 2014)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532440014535477). There is variation in study results depending on what type of restriction is being examined, but changing the number of clinics in an area [(Jones & Jerman, 2017;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28094905/) [Cunningham et al., 2018;](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23366/revisions/w23366.rev2.pdf?sy=366) [Nash & Dreweke, 2019)](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2019/09/us-abortion-rate-continues-drop-once-again-state-abortion-restrictions-are-not-main), increasing the effective price of an abortion or reducing medicaid funding [(Blank & London, 1996;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10164042/) [Medoff, 2007)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-007-9080-9), and implementing parental consent requirements [(Cartoof & Klerman, 1986;](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.76.4.397) [Medoff, 2007)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-007-9080-9), all reduce the incidence of abortion. Additionally, [Myers (2017)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/694293) used difference-in-difference estimates to show that it was not increased access to the birth control pill which led to substantial changes in family formation. Rather liberalized, access to abortion that allowed large numbers of women in the 1960s and 1970s to delay marriage and motherhood.  All of this evidence taken together suggests that it is likely the case that a hard ban on abortion in any area would reduce the incidence of abortion.

### Birth Rate

The evidence on the effects of abortion restrictions on the birth rate is fairly mixed, with some research suggesting that abortion restrictions increase birth rates [(Joyce et al., 2006)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa054047), and other research suggesting abortion restrictions have no effect or even decrease birth rates due to decreased pregnancies [(Levine et al., 1996)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10164043/#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%2012%20years,in%20births%2C%20implying%20fewer%20pregnancies). This discrepancy, however, can be solved through considering the distinction between hard restrictions (banning vs legalizing) and soft restrictions. Changing from hard restrictions to liberal abortion laws appears to drastically reduce births, which suggests that the reverse would increase births. However, modest changes in restrictions appear to have no effect on births [(Levine & Staiger, 2004)](https://digitalcommons.dartmouth.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3361&context=facoa). Therefore, it appears that hard restrictions do increase birth rates, while soft restrictions may not.

### Maternal Mortality

Research unanimously shows that bans on abortion lead to increases in maternal mortality, which are often very large [(Haddad & Nour, 2009;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/) [Benson et al., 2011;](https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4755-8-39) [Latt et al., 2019;](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12905-018-0705-y.pdf) [Marshall, 2021)](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/09/08/study-banning-abortion-would-boost-maternal-mortality-double-digits). This also appears to be the case with simple restrictions on abortion [(Vilda et al., 2021)](https://sph.tulane.edu/news/study-finds-higher-maternal-mortality-rates-states-more-abortion-restrictions).

## When Life Begins

95% of biologists affirm that life begins at conception [(Jacobs, 2018)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703).
