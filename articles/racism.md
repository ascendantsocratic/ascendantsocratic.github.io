## Bias

### Implicit Association Test

The implicit association test (IAT) is a test which aims to measure implicit biases [(Greenwald et al., 1998)](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.74.6.1464). This has been used primarily with regards to race, although there are equivalent tests for other biases. Implicit and explicit bias has been decreasing in genral against social groups including sexual orientation, race, skin tone, age, disability, and body weight [(Charlesworth & Banaji, 2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618813087).

Research suggests that the relationship between IAT results and explicit bias is relatively low, although a correlation exists nonetheless [(Hofmann et al., 2005)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167205275613). Although it is a poor predictor of explicit bias it is a good predictor of brain activity [(Oswald et al., 2013)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0032734). Associations vary widely depending on the "mental space" the person is in. This has been shown for police officers whose results vary day to day and based on sleep [(James, 2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1098611117732974).

In spite of the lack of predictive power of the IAT on individual behavior, individuals are able to predict their results on the IAT with a high degree of accuracy [(Hahn et al., 2014)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24294868/). This, along with evidence presented above, suggests that the IAT is measuring some real psychological state, even if it poorly predicts explicit behavior. While the IAT is lacking in terms of its predictive power of individual behavior, on the aggregate it has some predictive power. It doesn't appear to predict clinical decision-making [(Dehon et al., 2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acem.13214), but research suggests the IAT can predict system-justifying preferences of all kinds, discriminatory decision-making, political judgments and behaviors, and voting behavior [(Jost, 2018)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721418797309). Implicit measures are difficult to change, so arguably it isn't fruitful to establish procedures in whatever contexts which explicitly attempt to change people's implicit biases [(Forscher et al., 2019)](https://psyarxiv.com/dv8tu/).

### Liberal Racial Bias

**Liberal Racial bias does exist to a fairly large extent, and it is anti-white in nature, unlike other forms of racial bias. One large manifestation of this is biases in perceptions of information which political liberals have when compared to political conservatives. Political liberals, but not political conservatives are more censorious of anti-minority information when compared to anit-white information, and also view such information as less credible. This is despite the fact that many such individuals themselves believe that they should be unbiased in their judgements.**

[A Cross-cultural Analysis of Censorship on Campuses](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333677484_A_Cross-cultural_Analysis_of_Censorship_on_Campuses)

Methods:
- Looked at 595 American participants, who leaned slightly liberal on average
- They were read a variety of passages, including ones about men/women being better leaders; islam/christianity being violent; and black/white people scoring higher in intelligence tests.
- A second study replicated this in hundreds of college-aged students from the US, UK, and Hungary.
- A meta-analysis was then conducted among all 4 samples

Results:
- A more liberal ideology predicted more censorship support for passages that were anti-women, anti-islam, less for anti-christianity, and more for anti-black. All others were identical across ideology.
- The second study broadly replicated these findings.
- The meta-analysis also confirmed these findings
- Moreover, the sensitivity to negative information against low-status groups was also found amongst young conservatives, although to a lesser degree.

##IMAGE

Interpretations:
- This is likely due to an aversion to inequality and protection of low-status groups which are exhibited by political liberals

[Low-status groups as a domain of liberal bias](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326144740_Low-status_groups_as_a_domain_of_liberal_bias)

- Finds that political liberals consistently evaluate a study as less credible when the results conclude that a high-status group (men and whites) had higher intelligence than a lower-status group (women and blacks) than vice versa. Liberals when asked think they should not have such a double standard, yet still do nonetheless.

**This appears to be due to the liberal belief in the existence of discrimination, the rejection of biological group differences, and the belief in the possibility and moral necessity of the pursuit of racial equality in society.**

[Equalitarianism: A Source of Liberal Bias](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325033477_Equalitarianism_A_Source_of_Liberal_Bias)

- *“Here, we demonstrate that Liberals are particularly prone to bias about victims’ groups (e.g. Blacks, women) and identify a set of beliefs that consistently predict this bias, termed Equalitarianism. Equalitarianism, we believe, stems from an aversion to inequality and a desire to protect relatively low status groups, and includes three interrelated beliefs: (1) demographic groups do not differ biologically; (2) prejudice is ubiquitous and explains existing group disparities; (3) society can, and should, make all groups equal in society. This leads to bias against information that portrays a perceived privileged group more favorably than a perceived victims’ group.”*
- *“Liberalism was associated with perceiving certain groups as victims (Studies 1a-1b). In Studies 2-7 and meta-analyses, Liberals evaluated the same study as less credible when the results concluded that a privileged group (men and Whites) had a more desirable quality relative to a victims’ group (women and Blacks) than vice versa. Ruling out alternative explanations of Bayesian (or other normative) reasoning, significant order effects in within-subjects designs in Studies 6 and 7 suggest that Liberals believe they should not evaluate identical information differently depending on which group is portrayed more favorably, yet do so. In all studies, higher equalitarianism mediated the relationship between more liberal ideology and lower credibility ratings when privileged groups were said to score higher on a socially valuable trait. Although not predicted a priori, meta-analyses also revealed Moderates to be the most balanced in their judgments.”*

**Political liberals are also more likely to endorse consequentialism when the victim in question is white rather than black, which suggests that liberals are more sensitive to sacrificing black people when compared to white people.**

[The motivated use of moral principles](https://journal.sjdm.org/9616/jdm9616.pdf)

Methods:
- Study 1a used the traditional trolley problem of sacrificing one innocent person to save a group of people, except manipulating the race of individual to be sacrificed. - - This was then given in the form of a questionnaire to 88 undergraduate students, who were then asked their political affiliation
- Study 1b attempted to replicate this study using a slightly different hypothetical
- Study 2 used the same sample of people in study 1a and put a similar consequentialist problem in the form of 2 questions back to back, with the race of the person being sacrificed manipulated. Then a question of whether race should matter was asked.

Results:
- In study 1a liberals were more likely to endorse consequentialism when the victim had a stereotypically white name. Conservatives did not give reliably different endorsements of consequentialism. Similar results were found for study 1b.
- In study 2, reliability of answers between the 2 questions was very high, and everyone said race shouldn’t matter

Other Studies:
- Conservatives were more likely to endorse the unintended killing of innocent civilians when they were Iraqis rather than American, while liberals showed no significant effect

**Moreover, white liberals appear to be more nervous talking to minorities when compared to white people, likely due to a liberal hyper-sensitivity to racism against minority groups.**

[Color Blindness and Interracial Interaction: Playing the Political Correctness Game](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-22158-006)

- Finds that politically correct white people were less likely to talk about race with a minority than with a white person, and this avoidance was associated with less eye contact from whites and appearing less friendly toward black partners.

[Self-presentation in Interracial Settings: The Competence Downshift by White liberals](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-12064-001)

- Finds that white liberals, whether average people or politicians, present less competence to minorities than to other whites, suggesting that they draw on low competence stereotypes to affiliate with minorities.

**Finally, jokes against low-status groups are seen as worse by those with low system justification (who tend to be liberals) when compared to jokes against high-status groups, while there appears to be no bias by those with high system justification (who tend to be conservatives.**

[Low system justification drives ideological differences in joke perception: A critical commentary and re-analysis of Baltiansky et al. (2020)](https://psyarxiv.com/qv764)

- *“our re-analyses suggest that ideological differences in joke perception are driven primarily by those scoring low on the system justification motivation rating jokes about ostensibly low-status groups as less funny than jokes about other social groups.”*

**I think some of this can be justified to an extent given that minority groups are oppressed more on average, and therefore the same action within our societal context would have different outcomes, but a lot of this seems very excessive. Moreover, even with actions which are worse when done against minorities now, as time goes on it is likely that the harm done by both actions will approach identical amounts. If a certain action against a group of people is bad, and it contributes to oppression against that group, in the long-run whichever form of prejudice we promote implicitly as better than the other will result in that form of oppression perpetuating disproportionately. This happens regardless of the starting position of each group.**

### Use of Force

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Main</summary>

**The research on police use of force bias is all over the place, and this could be due to variation in research methods or variation in the actual phenomenon studied. Needless to say, the evidence is not 100% clear. Despite all of this, in my assessment, there is no disparity in police use of force conditional upon encounter. There does appear to be a disparity in police use of force once the initial probability of an encounter is taken into account. That is to say, police are not more likely to shoot a black person in a police encounter compared to a white person. However, once taking into account the probability of a police encounter occurring, there is a disparity.**

**Research looking at police use of force as a function of crime rates can help assess whether racial bias is at play. There appears to be an anti-white bias overall in this respect, although the picture becomes more nuanced when looking at unarmed vs armed civilian deaths. There is an anti-white bias when it comes to police exerting force on armed civilians, while there is an anti-black bias when it comes to police exerting force on unarmed civilians. Therefore, the picture is complex and it is unclear whether police use of force is on the net anti-white or anti-black.**

**It does appear though that a lot of the narrative around extensive police killings of unarmed black people decreases the mental health of black people.**

[Explaining the Disparity in Results Across Studies Assessing Racial Disparity in Police Use of Force: A Research Note](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-016-9378-y)

-   Literature review

-   Finds that there is high variation in findings of police use of force studies, even in laboratory settings. The variations could reflect variation in the actual phenomenon across agencies or geographic areas, or could reflect different research methods used to study the same phenomenon.

[Risk of being killed by police use of force in the United States by age, race--ethnicity, and sex](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793)

-   Among black men, police use of force is one of the leading causes of death

[Police-Related Deaths and Neighborhood Economic and Racial/Ethnic Polarization, United States, 2015--2016](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304851)

-   Finds that police-related death rates are highest among neighborhoods which are lower in income and which have a higher proportion of residents of color there.

  <summary>Experimental Shooting Studies</summary>

**The overall evidence according to meta-analysis suggests that there is a lower shooting threshold for black targets, although this is experimental and thus may not translate into real-world behavior.**

[The Reverse Racism Effect Are Cops More Hesitant to Shoot Black Than White Suspects?](https://media.spokesman.com/documents/2016/05/The_Reverse_Racism_Effect.pdf)

-   Experiment

-   Finds that while there is clear evidence of an implicit bias against black suspects by police, officers were slower to shoot armed black suspects than white suspects and less likely to shoot unarmed black suspects than unarmed white suspects.

[Is the evidence from racial bias shooting task studies a smoking gun? Results from a meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103115000992)

-   "We meta-analyzed 42 studies, investigating five operationalizations of shooter biases (reaction time with/without a gun, false alarms, shooting sensitivity, and shooting threshold) and relevant moderators (e.g., racial prejudice, state level gun laws). Our results indicated that relative to White targets, participants were quicker to shoot armed Black targets (dav = -.13, 95% CI [-.19, -.06]), slower to not shoot unarmed Black targets (dav = .11, 95% CI [.05, .18), and more likely to have a liberal shooting threshold for Black targets (dav = -.19, 95% CI [-.37, -.01])." 

-   Also found no evidence of publication bias

  <summary>Use of Force Within Encounter</summary>

**Within an encounter the overall evidence suggests that there is no racial bias on the decision to shoot a suspect, as is shown with meta-analytic evidence.**

[Just Following Orders: A Meta-Analysis of the Correlates of American Police Officer Use of Force Decisions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-014-9278-y)

-   There are a number of narrative reviews on the subject of use of force decisions by American police officers

-   However, there is a reliance on professional expertise to draw valid conclusions in the case of contradictory results between studies. This can cause different conclusions to be reached by different authors even when presented with the same literature set.

-   Study is a meta-analysis of 44 separate analyses from 19 articles.

-   The literature overall suggests an inconsistent relationship between race and use of force, with most research suggesting it's null overall and some suggesting it's an anti-black effect

-   Officer race also appears to have no effect on use of force

-   Exclusion criteria of studies following literature search:     

-   "The first requirement is that studies must have been published between 1995 and 2013."

-   "Second, only studies that included patrol officers as the sample under study were used." (As opposed to detectives)

-   "Third, sufficient statistical information was needed to allow for the calculation of an effect size."

-   "Fourth, studies that measured use of force through a "force factor" were excluded. These measures incorporate suspect resistance into the dependent variable and are thus substantively different from the focus of this study. This is not a judgment of whether use of force research should include suspect as an independent variable or within the dependent variable, but it is a judgment that including these studies would contribute to the potential violation of the homogeneity assumption of meta-analyses. Furthermore, including force factor studies would introduce an independent variable of the present analysis as part of the dependent variable. Doing so would render the present analysis non-recursive."  

-   "Fifth, the collected data must have been at the micro level---data collected at the encounter or suspect level. Only those studies that recorded officer decisions during encounters with citizens were included. Studies that were excluded due to this requirement measured use of force in a variety of manners; including hypothetical vignettes, citizen attitudes regarding use of force decisions, and simulated training environments. All of these are conceptually distinct from decisions made in the field."

-   "Sixth, studies that included a sample where all encounters involved use of force were excluded. Much of the same logic applied for excluding force factor studies also applies here. Studies that only include encounters where force was used by an officer are distinct from studies that include all encounters between officers and citizens. This truncates the dependent variable, and including these studies would again inflate heterogeneity issues." 

-   "Seventh, only multivariate tests were included to reduce the chance of including studies that may be misspecified. If a study only included a single explanatory variable, there is a substantial chance that the finding is spurious. Research on use of force, and police decision-making in general, has long since moved beyond these relatively simple methodological designs."

-   "Nineteen studies met all of these criteria."

-   To adjust for publication bias, trim-and-fill was used. Before, race was a significant predictor, but afterwards it lost significance. 

-   "Unfortunately, who the suspect is also appears to play a role in use of force decisions. Suspects who are minorities, males, and/or lower class are more likely to have force used against them. Obviously, it is inappropriate for officers to base coercive decisions upon suspects' demographic characteristics, but these results follow Kochel et al.'s (2011) finding that race plays a significant, but relatively minor role in officer decision-making."

-   "Of the variables that were shown to be significantly correlated with use of force decisions, offense seriousness, the number of officers onscene, suspect race, and suspect demeanor reversed were no longer significantly correlated when adjusted for publication bias. Even further caution should be taken when considering these variables as correlates of force decision-making."

[An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force](https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force)

-   Finds that blacks and hispanics are disproportionately likely to experience both lethal and non-lethal use of force 

-   Controlling for variables which take into account context and civilian behavior does not fully explain the disparity in non-lethal use of force, but does fully explain the lethal use of force disparity.

[Roland Fryer is wrong: There is racial bias in shootings by police](https://scholar.harvard.edu/jfeldman/blog/roland-fryer-wrong-there-racial-bias-shootings-police)

-   "Economic theory aside, there is an even more fundamental problem with the Houston police shooting analysis. In a typical study, a researcher will start with a previously defined population where each individual is at risk of a particular outcome. For instance, a population of drivers stopped by police can have one of two outcomes: they can be arrested, or they can be sent on their way. Instead of following this standard approach, Fryer constructs a fictitious population of people who are shot by police and people who are arrested. The problem here is that these two groups (those shot and those arrested) are, in all likelihood, systematically different from one another in ways that cannot be controlled for statistically" 

-   "Properly interpreted, the actual result from Fryer's analysis is that the racial disparity in arrest rates is larger than the racial disparity in police shootings. This is an unsurprising finding, and proves neither a lack of bias nor a lack of systematic discrimination."

[The Police Officer's Dilemma: A Decade of Research on Racial Bias in the Decision to Shoot](http://www.csun.edu/~dma/Correll,%20Hudson,%20Guillermo,%20&%20Ma%20(2014).pdf)

-   Literature review

-   Finds that while police officers are affected by target race in some respects, they do not generally show a pattern of biased shooting, and this performance depends on the exercise of cognitive control, which allows officers to overcome the influence of stereotypes.

[The effect of suspect race on police officers' decisions to draw their weapons](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2020.1760331)

-   "Using 2017 use-of-force data from the Dallas Police Department, we modeled officers' decisions to draw their weapons as a function of suspect race and other suspect, officer, and incident characteristics. We benchmarked by limiting analyses to arrest and active aggression cases, thereby excluding interactions in which it was less likely suspects would have had weapons drawn against them. The key finding was that black suspects were no more or less likely to have weapons drawn against them than other suspects."

[The Effects of Suspect Race and Situation Hazard on Police Officer Shooting Behavior](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1977.tb02415.x)

-   "fatalities are examined with respect to involvement in shooting and arrest rates. The results suggest an effect for degree of hazard; however, there was no evidence to suggest police bias against Blacks."

[A Bird's Eye View of Civilians Killed by Police in 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9133.12269)

-   "We analyzed 990 police fatal shootings using data compiled by The Washington Post in 2015."

-   "The results indicated civilians from "other" minority groups were significantly more likely than Whites to have not been attacking the officer(s) or other civilians and that Black civilians were more than twice as likely as White civilians to have been unarmed."

  <summary>Use of Force in General</summary>

**The evidence overall suggests that when accounting for the differential probability of arrest of black and white suspects there is a disparity in police use of force.**

[Lethal Force in Black and White: Assessing Racial Disparities in the Circumstances of Police Killings](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/703541)

-   "To assess whether and how these circumstances predict the race of a decedent, I use machine learning techniques and a novel data set of police killings containing over 120 descriptors. I find that decedent characteristics, criminal activity, threat levels, police actions, and the setting of the lethal interaction are not predictive of race, indicating that the police---given contact---are killing blacks and whites under largely similar circumstances. The findings suggest that the racial disparity in the rate of lethal force is most likely driven by higher rates of police contact among African Americans rather than racial differences in the circumstances of the interaction and officer bias in the application of lethal force."

-   "[The models'] low prediction accuracy indicates that there are likely only marginal racial differences in the observable circumstances of police killings. Although African Americans are more likely to be killed by police, as a whole their lethal interactions are remarkably similar to those of white decedents." 

-   "On the other hand, these results do indirectly point to the probable source of the threefold racial difference in the rate of police killings. As previously discussed, the null result indicates that the racial disparity is most likely originating from the contact stage of the lethal interaction process. Because the analysis only examines incidents where a person was killed, it is not possible to confirm this conclusion quantitatively, but analytically it is improbable for there to be strong racial differences in either the interaction or trigger stage given the findings. As a result the most likely explanation for the difference in rates is that African Americans have more frequent contact with the police, leading to a higher risk of being killed by law enforcement."

[Police Use of Force as an Extension of Arrests: Examining Disparities across Civilian and Officer Race](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20191028)

-   Finds that black civilians are more likely to be involved in a use of force incident during an arrest, but this stems from differences in initial likelihood of arrest.

[A Social Scientific Approach toward Understanding Racial Disparities in Police Shooting: Data from the Department of Justice (1980-2000)](https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/josi.12243) 

-   Study of 213 metropolitan areas over a 21-year period

-   Finds that even after controlling for racial differences in criminal activity (a proxy for behavior), officers are still more likely to shoot black suspects

[Resolution of apparent paradoxes in the race-specific frequency of use-of-force by police](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0110-z)

-   Finds that while there is a racial bias against white individuals with officers' probability to shoot and use lethal force, this is reversed when accounting for the racial disparity in probability of police encounter.

[Race and Reasonableness in Police Killings](https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3660&context=faculty_scholarship)

-   Finds that differences in circumstances do not explain the disparity between black and whites in police killings.

-   The standards in constitutional case law fail to anticipate the circumstances surrounding these types of interactions 

-   Enhanced police training appears to be ineffective, likely because it does not take into account the importance of race in officers' perceptions of risk and their decision-making.

[A Multi-Level Bayesian Analysis of Racial Bias in Police Shootings at the County-Level in the United States, 2011--2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0141854) 

-   Finds that racial bias is more likely to emerge in metropolitan areas with more black people and lower incomes, especially when there is high financial inequality in the county. 

-   There was no relationship between bias and crime rates, suggesting that differential crime rates do not explain this bias.

[On Racial Disparities in Recent Fatal Police Shootings](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2330443X.2019.1704330?needAccess=true)

-   Finds that a racial disparity in shooting victims persists even after controlling for local population and arrest demographics.

-   There is no evidence that police-worn body cameras impact the racial distribution of victims.

**This disparity turns anti-white when controlling for crime. However, once disaggregating between armed criminals and unarmed innocent civilians, there is an anti-white bias against armed criminals and an anti-black bias against unarmed innocent civilians.**

[Is There Evidence of Racial Disparity in Police Use of Deadly Force? Analyses of Officer-Involved Fatal Shootings in 2015--2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618775108)

-   Finds that looking at the racial disparity in shootings as a proportion of crime rather than population suggests that there is no racial disparity in fatal shootings by police.

[Racial Disparities in Police Use of Deadly Force Against Unarmed Individuals Persist After Appropriately Benchmarking Shooting Data on Violent Crime Rates](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1948550620916071)

-   Responds to Cesario et al., 2019

-   Finds that when separating between armed criminals and unarmed non-criminals and then controlling for crime rates, there is an anti-white disparity for armed criminals, but there is an anti-black disparity for unarmed noncriminals

  <summary>Effect of Officer Race</summary>

**There is no consistent evidence suggesting that officer race substantially affects police use of force.**

[Do White Law Enforcement Officers Target Minority Suspects](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/puar.12956)

-   Finds that although minority suspects are disproportionately killed by police, white officers appear to be no more likely to use lethal force against minorities than non-white officers.

[Officer characteristics and racial disparities in fatal officer-involved shootings](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877) 

-   Finds no racial disparity in shootings at all by officers

-   Officer race does not appear to affect this disparity

-   However, a retraction to the study states that this study does not say anything about whether there is a racial disparity in shootings at all by officers, only whether officer race has any effect.

[Making inferences about racial disparities in police violence](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1919418117)

-   Response to above study

-   Points out that the disparity in shooting couldn't be calculated because it wasn't a per-capita estimate, it was only looking at the absolute number of shootings.

[Does Race Matter for Police Use of Force? Evidence From 911 Calls](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26774/w26774.pdf)

-   White officers increase use of force more than black officers when in minority neighborhoods, but not in white or mixed neighborhoods

-   Black and hispanic civilians are five times more likely to experience gun use of force by white officers compared to if white officers scaled up use of force similarly to black officers.

[Will more black cops matter? Officer race and police-involved homicides of black citizens](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/puar.12734)

-   While evidence is weak, the contradictions between studies may be due to the number of black police only mattering past an inflection point in which race-neutral norms are now internalized. Before that, the norms don't exist so more black cops won't solve racism in use of force.

### Sentencing

All else equal, there is a small racial disparity in which African-Americans and Latinos are generally sentenced more harshly than whites [(Spohn, 2000;](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cassia-Spohn/publication/237754097_Thirty_Years_of_Sentencing_Reform_The_Quest_for_a_Racially_Neutral_Sentencing_Process/links/53f674170cf2fceacc735a5b/Thirty-Years-of-Sentencing-Reform-The-Quest-for-a-Racially-Neutral-Sentencing-Process.pdf?origin=publication_detail)  [Mitchell & MacKenzie, 2004;](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/208129.pdf)  [Kansal & Mauer, 2005;](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/uploads/764bf150-13d8-4330-b08b-b04ae313308f/disparity.pdf)  [Mitchell, 2005;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-005-7362-7)  [BJS, 2015;](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fsd0512_sum.pdf)  [Burch, 2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jels.12077). This sentencing disparity becomes larter when looking at decisions which are more discretionary, and structured sentencing mechanisms such as sentencing guidelines are associated with smaller unwarranted sentencing disparities [(Mitchell & MacKenzie, 2004)](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/208129.pdf). This suggests that racial bias plays a role in sentencing decisions. Republican-appointed judges tend to sentence blacks and males to more months than similar females and non-blacks compared to Democratic-appointed judges [(Cohen & Yang, 2018)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24615).

Minority offenders also face greater odds of being charged or fully prosecuted than white offenders [(Wu, 2016;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/0093854815628026)  [BJA, 2011)](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/PleaBargainingResearchSummary.pdf). White defendants are 25% more likely than black defendants to have their initial charge dropped or reduced to a lesser crime, a disparity that goes away when comparing white and black defendants with prior convictions [(Berdejó, 2017)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3036726).

African-American prisoners convicted of murder or rape are more likely to be innocent than other convicted murderers or rapists [(Gross et al., 2017)](http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Race_and_Wrongful_Convictions.pdf)

Complaints by black and Latino citizens against white officers are less likely to be sustained, while incidents alleged by white citizens in high-crime and predominantly black neighborhoods are more likely to be sustained [(Faber et al., 2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/cico.12388).

Even after controlling for previous professional and judicial experience, educational background, qualification ratings, and differences in appellate panel composition, black federal district judges are consistently overturned on appeal more often than white district judges [(Sen, 2015)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/msen/files/sen_reversal.pdf).\
Black defendants are assigned greater bail levels than whites accused of similar offenses [(Gelbach & Bushway, 2012)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990324).

## Economics

### Employment

**Meta-analytical evidence suggests that identical resumes sent to employers, with the only difference in resume being name, result in different rates of callbacks, with resumes with white-sounding names getting more callbacks than resumes with black or Latino-sounding names.**

[Meta-analysis of field experiments shows no change in racial discrimination in hiring over time](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/41/10870)

-   Meta-analysis of 28 studies

-   Finds that since 1989, whites on average receive 36% more callbacks from job applications than African Americans, and 24% more callbacks than Latinos

-   There was no change in the 25 years for African Americans, but there was for Latinos.

[Ethnic discrimination in hiring decisions: a meta-analysis of correspondence tests 1990--2015](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2015.1133279?journalCode=cjms20)

-   Meta-analysis of 43 studies

-   Finds substantive evidence of racial discrimination in hiring against minority applicants of all races, and is also robust to the generation of an immigrant.

##IMAGE

There is a slight publication bias in favor of more extreme results, so most studies tend to overestimate this effect, but it's not substantial enough to nullify the effect once controlled for.

[Ethnic discrimination in hiring decisions: a meta-analysis of correspondence tests 1990--2015](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2015.1133279?journalCode=cjms20)

-   There is publication bias in the literature, as shown by the graph below (black dots are individual studies and white dots are results needed to balance the picture

##IMAGE

**Some have theorized that rather than this discrimination being due to irrational biases on the part of employers, it is instead due to employers using race as a proxy for unobservable characteristics which also affect an individual's job performance beyond what is included on a resume. There is some evidence for this hypothesis being true, but it doesn't seem to account for all of the discrimination observed. Covariates such as the inclusion of a criminal record don't appear to substantially affect the results, which one would expect to decrease the disparity if the statistical discrimination hypothesis was true. Some data which looks at variations in resume quality and increases in data in general also reveal a similar pattern, although this is contradicted by other evidence. This suggests there may be some statistical discrimination at play but it does not account for the totality of the explanation for the hiring gap.**

[Ethnic discrimination in hiring decisions: a meta-analysis of correspondence tests 1990--2015](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2015.1133279?journalCode=cjms20)

-   Given the similar hiring decisions for immigrants of different generations, this suggests that there is taste-based discrimination

-   However, statistical discrimination also appears to play a role, as shown by differences in German-speaking countries where more extensive application material is the norm and from public sector employers where application material is more standardized, there is more attention to diversity, and non-discriminatory hiring practices are often explicitly sought.

[Meta-analysis of field experiments shows no change in racial discrimination in hiring over time](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/41/10870)

-   An appendix looked at how covariates, such as criminal record could affect the results, and concluded that "Excluding auditors with criminal records and limiting our study to only resume audit studies both produce no trend in discrimination ratios for African-Americans. We conclude that there are no trends in the covariates that appear potentially problematic for our results."

[Evidence from Field Experiments in Hiring Shows Substantial Additional Racial Discrimination after the Callback](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/99/2/732/5816667)

-   "Our results also provide evidence against the view that most racial discrimination in hiring reflects statistical discrimination, at least on the characteristics employers can assess during an interview. If the main reason employers discriminate is statistical, employers should be less likely to rely on group stereotypes in drawing conclusions about applicants as their information about an individual applicant increases. In interviews, employers receive additional information regarding (at least) the dress, appearance and demeanor of applicants. Yet we find as much discrimination or more from interview to job offer as from application to callback, suggesting that the extra interview information is not significantly counter-acting employer biases."

[Detecting Discrimination in Audit and Correspondence Studies](https://www.nber.org/papers/w16448)

-   "This paper shows that if a correspondence study includes observable measures of variation in applicants' quality that affect hiring outcomes, an unbiased estimate of discrimination can be recovered even when there are group differences in the variances of the unobservable. The method is applied to Bertrand and Mullainathan's (2004) correspondence study, and leads to stronger evidence of race discrimination that adversely affects blacks than is obtained when differences in the variances of the unobservable are ignored."

**Another piece of evidence for the statistical discrimination hypothesis is how "ban the box" policies which restrict employers from asking about applicants' criminal histories on job applications result in more discrimination happening against minorities, suggesting that decreasing information to employers, through increasing their reliance on unobservable measures of competence in a job, increases statistical discrimination.**

[Ban the Box, Criminal Records, and Statistical Discrimination: A Field Experiment](https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/workshop/leo/leo16_starr.pdf)

-   Looks at the effect that "Ban-the-Box" policies (policies which restrict employers from asking about applicants' criminal histories on job applications) have on employment discrimination.

-   Finds that following the implementation of BTB policies in New Jersey and New York City the race gap goes from whites receiving 7% more callbacks than similar black applicants to a 45% difference.

[The Unintended Consequences of "Ban the Box": Statistical Discrimination and Employment Outcomes When Criminal Histories Are Hidden](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/705880)

-   "We use variation in the timing of BTB policies to test BTB's effects on employment. We find that BTB policies decrease the probability of employment by 3.4 percentage points (5.1%) for young, low-skilled black men."

**It has been demonstrated that if the effect of improved productivity signals or resumes to employers on hiring is nonlinear, certain ways in which unobserved skills can be distributed between two populations can result in discrimination being shown in studies when it doesn't exist. Unfortunately, this may mean that none of this data definitively demonstrates the existence of racial bias in hiring, although I am intuitively skeptical of the idea that the relationship is nonlinear beyond initial requirements for a job.**

[Detecting Discrimination](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2646964?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

-   Correspondence testing studies presuppose that the effect of improved resume or productivity signals to employers is linear, which it is not necessarily. If it isn't, and there are differences in the variance of productivity between blacks and whites, even assuming the same mean productivity level, then the cutoff might favor blacks or whites even if mean productivity is the same. Given that mean productivity is held constant in correspondence testing studies, it is possible to see differences in callbacks between the two groups even when there is no actual bias at play, and it is impossible to rule this out as a possibility.

**However, the actual influence this has on the results of audit studies must be very large, as evidence has suggested that with identical resumes, a black applicant without a criminal record is less likely to be called back for a job interview than a white applicant with a criminal record, in spite of the fact that a criminal record has a drastic effect on a person's probability of being employed. Because such an effect must be very large, without evidence in favor of an effect even being real it seems reasonable to assume that it likely at least does not eliminate all of the discrimination that is observed in the studies presented above.**

[The Mark of a Criminal Record](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/374403)

[Racial discrimination continues to play a part in hiring decisions](https://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_snapshots_archive_09172003/)

-   "mere contact with the criminal justice system, in the absence of any transformative or selective effects, severely limits subsequent employment opportunities."

-   "Blacks are less than half as likely to receive consideration by employers, relative to their white counterparts, and black nonoffenders fall behind even whites with prior felony convictions. The powerful effects of race thus continue to direct employment decisions in ways that contribute to persisting racial inequality"

-   "Except for the differences in race and in criminal record, applicants were given comparable resumes, sent to the same set of employers, and trained to behave similarly in the application process."

-   "The study focused on the likelihood that an applicant would be called back for a job interview. Not surprisingly, whites without a criminal record were most likely to be invited back (34%) and blacks with a criminal record were the least likely (5%). Perhaps most striking, the study found that only 14% of blacks without a criminal record were called back for an interview---less than the 17% of whites that did have a criminal record."

##IMAGE

**Interestingly, there is evidence suggesting that the discrimination occurring is partially class-based, as black-sounding names with a more positive socioeconomic connotation don't appear to be discriminated against. This doesn't disprove that unjust racial discrimination is occurring, but it does suggest that it is concentrated on the intersection between race and class.**

[How Black Are Lakisha and Jamal? Racial Perceptions from Names Used in Correspondence Audit Studies](https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-4/september/SocSci_v4_469to489.pdf)

-   Survey experiment

-   Finds that names given more commonly by highly educated black mothers, such as Jalen and Nia, are less likely to be perceived as black than names given by less educated black mothers, such as DaShawn and Tanisha.

-   This suggests that evidence on racial discrimination operates under a false assumption that all black names are alike.

[Race and gender effects on employer interest in job applicants: new evidence from a resume field experiment](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2015.1114571)

-   Resume experiment

-   Assigns names to the resumes that convey race and gender but for which a strong negative socioeconomic connotation is not implicated:

-   "We selected last names suggestive of race for black, Hispanic and white applicants. Applicants' first names were used to convey gender, and in the case of Hispanic applicants also were indicative of ethnicity. Specifically, we used three female-sounding first names -- Isabella, Megan and Chloe -- and three male-sounding first names -- Brian, Carlos and Ryan. The first names Isabella and Carlos were paired with Hernandez and Garcia to suggest Hispanic origin, while Chloe and Ryan were paired with Washington and Jefferson to indicate an African American applicant. For white applicants, the first names Megan and Brian were paired with Anderson and Thompson."

-   Finds little evidence of systematic employer preferences for applicants from particular race or gender groups.

**In response to the discrimination that minorities face in the labor market, many racial minorities attempt to make their resumes more "white" in appearance. However, when applying for jobs with employers who present themselves as valuing diversity, minorities engage less in this. Unfortunately, organizational diversity statements are not actually associated with reduced discrimination against unwhitened resumes so pro-diversity employers are actually more discriminatory in effect.**

[Whitened Résumés: Race and Self-Presentation in the Labor Market](http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Whitening%20MS%20R2%20Accepted.pdf)

-   Many racial minorities will engage in the practice of whitening their resumes by concealing or downplaying racial cues in their job applications.

-   However, when targeting an employer that presents itself as valuing diversity, minority job applicants engage in relatively little resume whitening, but organizational diversity statements are not actually associated with reduced discrimination against unwhitened resumes

-   Therefore, minorities may be particularly likely to experience disadvantage when applying to ostensibly pro-diversity employers.

### Housing

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Mortgage Discrimination</summary>

**There is evidence of mortgage discrimination occurring against blacks who have identical credit profiles, in terms of rejecting more profiles and having higher mortgage interest rates. Evidence as shown later suggests that this is due to statistical discrimination.**

[Racial Discrimination in the U.S. Housing and Mortgage Lending Markets: A Quantitative Review of Trends, 1976--2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12552-019-09276-x)

-   Looks at time series results from 16 field experiments of housing discrimination and 19 observational studies of mortgage lending discrimination

-   Finds evidence of a decline in housing discrimination from the late 1970s to the present

-   The decline is strongest for discrimination involving direct denial of housing availability, and weaker for measures reflecting the number of units recommended and inspected, and significant discrimination remains for these outcomes.

-   Racial gaps in loan denial have declined only slightly, and racial gaps in mortgage cost (interest rate) have not declined at all, suggesting persistent discrimination

[What's in a Picture? Evidence of Discrimination from Prosper.com](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25764804)

-   Finds that loan listings with blacks in the attached picture are 25-35% less likely than whites with similar credit profiles

[Racial discrepancy in mortgage interest rates](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11146-014-9473-0)

-   "Using data from three waves of the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finance, our results suggest that black borrowers on average pay about 29 basis points more than comparable white borrowers. We also find that rate disparity mainly occurs to young borrowers with low education as well as those borrowers whose income and credit disqualify them for prime lending rates. Furthermore, among borrowers in the higher rate groups, black women seem to receive much more disparate treatment than black men. We conclude that, while the racial disparity in mortgage rates is widespread between black and white borrowers, it is the more financially vulnerable black women who suffer the most."

##IMAGE##IMAGE

**Even controlling for credit score, black people are more likely to default on their mortgage, meaning it makes sense to accept fewer applicants.**

[Race, redlining, and residential mortgage loan performance](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01099279)

-   "In terms of the race or ethnic background of the borrower, results indicate a higher likelihood of default on the part of black households (compared to white households), while Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian or Alaskan native households are, for the most part, statistically indistinguishable from white borrowers with respect to default risk."

[Report to the Congress on Credit Scoring and Its Effects on the Availability and Affordability of Credit](https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/creditscore/creditscore.pdf)

-   "Consistently, across all three credit scores and all five performance measures, blacks, single individuals, individuals residing in lower-income or predominantly minority census tracts show consistently higher incidences of bad performance than would be predicted by the credit scores."

-   "The data also track the performance difference for each loan category by creditscore group. In almost every category, blacks show a higher incidence of default than non-Hispanic white borrowers, although differences are, in some cases, small. However, two product areas, auto loans from finance companies and credit card loans, show consistently higher and larger default rates for blacks than for non-Hispanic white borrowers for all credit-score quintiles."

**As for mortgage costs, these completely go away when accounting for differences in discount points, which black borrowers pay fewer of. On net, mortgage costs appear to be identical.**

[Do Minorities Pay More for Mortgages?](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/34/2/763/5827007#226627786)

-   Finds gaps by race and ethnicity in interest rates which are offset by differences in discount points

-   Black and hispanic borrowers pay fewer discount points

-   Black and hispanic borrowers face a point rate schedule equal to that of white borrowers, although they sort to different locations on that schedule

-   "In other words, lenders compensate minority and white borrowers equally when they select a higher interest rate, across the entire range of interest rates."

-   There were no differences in total fees by race or ethnicity

**Further evidence that whatever discrimination occurs is statistical discrimination comes from the fact that profits are equal or less from black borrowers compared to white borrowers, suggesting that black people are not being systematically disadvantaged from the lending policy.**

[What's in a Picture? Evidence of Discrimination from Prosper.com](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25764804)

-   While loan discrimination occurs against blacks, lenders still earn a lower net return for loans to blacks compared to loans to whites

##IMAGE

[Do Minorities Pay More for Mortgages?](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/34/2/763/5827007#226627786)

-   Lenders were found to earn slightly higher revenue and higher profit on mortgages from minorities people, but not because the lenders charged higher prices to minority borrowers but because they are able to extract higher margins from borrowers regardless of race and ethnicity who want lower upfront costs.

  <summary>Rental Discrimination</summary>

**There is also discrimination in the rental housing market, although it appears that much of it is due to statistical discrimination as well.**

[Closed doors everywhere? A meta-analysis of field experiments on ethnic discrimination in rental housing markets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369183X.2018.1489223)

-   "this article provides a quantitative meta-analysis of field experiments (in person audits and correspondence tests) that were run over the last four decades in the United States, Canada and Europe (N = 71). Special focus is given to a possible inflation of effect sizes by publication bias; to time trends; and to evidence for statistical discrimination. Taken together, nearly all experiments document the occurrence of ethnic discrimination. Effect sizes are inflated by publication bias, but there is still substantial evidence left once the bias is removed. The analysis reveals a consistent decline in the extent of discrimination over time, from moderate levels of discrimination in the 1970s and 1980s, up to only small but still statistically significant levels in the 1990s and 2000s. A significant part of the discriminatory behaviour can be attributed to missing information about the social status of applicants, which supports theories on statistical discrimination."

## Mental Health

**White people on average have lower self-esteem, mental health, and higher suicide than at least some minority groups.**

[Race and self-esteem: meta-analyses comparing whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians and comment on Gray-Little and Hafdahl (2000)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12002695/)

-   Meta-analysis

-   Finds that blacks scored higher than whites in terms of self-esteem, but whites scored higher than Asians, Hispanics, and American Indians.

-   Most of these differences were small in childhood but grew with age

-   Blacks' self-esteem was originally smaller than whites until the 1980s.

-   Relative to whites, minority males had lower self-esteem than minority females, and black and Hispanic self-esteem was higher in groups with high socioeconomic status

-   These results are most consistent with a cultural explanation for racial differences in self-esteem

[Mental Health Disparities: Diverse Populations](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Cultural-Competency/Mental-Health-Disparities/Mental-Health-Facts-for-Diverse-Populations.pdf)

-   Rates of depression are lower in blacks (24.6%) and hispanics (19.6%) than in whites (34.7), although depression in blacks and hispanics is likely to be more persistent

-   White Americans are more likely to die by suicide than people of other ethnic/racial groups

-   Lack of cultural understanding by healthcare providers may contribute to underdiagnosis and/or misdiagnosis of mental illness in people from racially/ethnically diverse populations.

-   People from racial/ethnic minority groups with mental illnesses are less likely to receive mental healthcare.

-   Barriers to care may include:

-   Lack of insurance, underinsurance

-   Mental illness stigma, often greater among mental healthcare providers

-   Lack of culturally competent providers

-   Language barriers

-   Distrust in the healthcare system

-   Inadequate support for mental health service in safety net settings

[Diagnosed Mental Health Conditions and Risk of Suicide Mortality](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201800346)

-   Nearly all diagnoses of mental health conditions are associated with an increased risk of suicide

-   **Therefore, suicide rates are a decent proxy for mental illness rates, which suggests that high white suicide rates reflect higher levels of mental illness among whites**

[Trends in Suicide Rates by Race and Ethnicity in the United States](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2780380)

-   "For both male and female youth aged 15 to 24 years, suicide rates were higher among American Indian or Alaskan Native youth (eg, 2019 rate among female youth: 23.0 per 100 000 individuals) and White youth (6.1 per 100 000 individuals) relative to Black youth (4.3 per 100 000 individuals), Asian or Pacific Islander youth (5.1 per 100 000 individuals), and Hispanic youth (4.4 per 100 000 individuals) for all years."

## Model Minority

**Positive stereotypes about Asians appear to be harmful to the mental health of Asians, are correlated with negative stereotypes of Asians, and also fail to take into account the diversity among Asians, some who score lower than white people in academics. Moreover, even after controlling for education and other relevant characteristics most Asian ethnicities for the main exception of Japanese earn less than whites, although they are more educationally successful. Asians have higher median household and individual income. Academic differences between Asians and whites appear to be due to differences in family background.**

-   Although median household income is higher for Asian families than white families, individual per-capita income was formerly lower for Asians

-   Moreover, after adjusting for education, weeks worked, age, and region of residence, Asians were found to earn considerably less than their white counterparts

-   However later on, Asians had higher individual and household income than whites and also significantly higher education.

-   Still, later analyses still found that for most Asian ethnic groups, after controlling for factors such as education they earned less than whites, except for Japanese people and possibly Koreans.

-   Regional differences in adjusted earnings were also found

-   The model minority myth, as it first appeared in a 1966 article, was deliberately made because the US government needed a way to shift negative international attention away from itself

-   The expectation of overachievement diminishes individual accomplishment and diversity amongst Asians

-   The myth insulated politicians from accusations that black people were unsuccessful because of racism and discrimination

-   Asians experience mental health challenges, and due to the perception that they are successful and don't have mental health problems, their mental health needs go largely unmet

  <summary>In College: Effect on Minority Admissions</summary>

  <summary>In College: Effect on Minority Performance and Labor Market Effects</summary>

**While affirmative action undoubtedly does increase the admission of minorities into universities, there is debate about if this comes at the expense of minorities, who may suffer from being put into more difficult courses. This effect is known as mismatch. There is some research which suggests that mismatch occurs, with the most important study looking at law school affirmative action.**

[A Systemic Analysis of Affirmative Action in American Law Schools](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40040209)

The effects of affirmative action on academic performance in law school:

-   Table 5.2 shows that after controlling for prior LSAT scores and GPA, there is no statistically significant relationship between race and performance in law schools, meaning that LSAT and GPA are important over race in explaining grades.

-   Therefore, the poor performance of black students at law schools appears to be primarily a function of disparate entering credentials, which is explained by law schools' heavy use of racial preferences.

-   In fact, blacks are heavily concentrated among low performers in almost all law schools in the US, except for those that are historically minority law schools

-   Among black students who graduate law school, their grades slightly drop relative to everyone else.

-   Black students also tend to drop out more in law school. One study found that 8.2% of the white students, but 19.2% of the black students, who started law school in 1991 had not graduated by the end of the study 5 years later.

-   However, one could argue that black attrition could be lowered through racial preferences, as elite law schools have higher graduation rates than other law schools.

-   Law school eliteness independently of gpa predicts law school graduation, but gpa is a stronger predictor. Race alone isn't a predictor after controlling for these and several other factors, such as family income.

-   Therefore, those who receive preferences to go to more elite law schools derive some benefit from higher general graduation rates, but get much lower grades and thus on the balance, drop out more.

-   Racial preferences appear to have an effect equivalent to lowering the index of the typical black student by 60 to 80 points. This results in a high attrition disparity between blacks and whites.

Conclusion

-   The main advantage of affirmative action is that it increases the number of black students in law schools in general and also prestigious law schools. However, they are as a whole disadvantaged when affirmative action is in place, with lower GPAs and higher attrition.

-   As a consequence, blacks are less likely than whites to pass state bar exams after multiple attempts. However, when they do pass the bar, they have a slight earning advantage than whites seeking similar jobs with similar credentials likely due to racial preferences in hiring.

-   When taking into account the negative effects of affirmative action on graduation and passing the bar, affirmative action probably tends to decrease the number of new black lawyers.

-   Note: Assumes effects of GPA and SAT on school performance are uniform for races

**Unfortunately, this study has the problem of presupposing in their regression models that the effect of GPA and SAT performance is uniform for races. When not looking at average effects, a different picture is painted in which prior performance is less of a predictor of future performance for black people. Moreover, the effect of school selectivity on performance is negative for the general population, but looking specifically at black people it positively predicts performance.**

[Does Affirmative Action Work? Caste, Gender, College Quality, and Academic Success in India](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20140783)

-   "We study the effects of one such affirmative action program: an admissions policy that fixes percentage quotas, common across more than 200 engineering colleges, for disadvantaged castes and for women."

-   "An important concern is that affirmative action might harm intended beneficiaries by placing them in academic programs for which they are ill-prepared. We find no evidence of such adverse impacts."

[Understanding Affirmative Action](https://diversity.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/understanding_affrirmative_action.pdf)

-   Literature review

-   Those admitted as a result of race-sensitive admissions policies graduated at the same rate as white students

-   This was all shown by a study which analyzed over 80,000 students who had matriculated at 28 elite colleges and universities in 1951, 1976, and 1989.

-   Colleges and universities cannot achieve ethnic diversity if class representation is the only factor represented

-   One study did suggest that minority attrition increased following affirmative action (The study a systematic analysis of affirmative action in American law schools), but the study assumed that the relationship between initial grades and law school grades are the same among black students as white students, which is false, among other issues.

[Affirmative Action: What Do We Know?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30162729.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab5df27a45b1892b4eddfe0f728629c58&ab_segments=&origin=)

-   Literature review

-   If it is the case that affirmative action in admissions is allowing less qualified minorities to enter more selective schools, their grades relative to whites would drop as college selectivity rose, and their dropout rates would be higher at such schools, especially for minority students with the lowest relative SAT scores.

-   For blacks, the evidence suggests that college selectivity improves graduation rates, but negative effects for the general population, so therefore affirmative action in university generates no harm and probably some gains in graduation rates and later earnings for minorities who attend more elite colleges and universities.

-   Law school quality conditional on college grades and LSAT scores increases rather than decreases bar passage and graduation rates in law schools for blacks

**The mismatch effect could still nonetheless occur for some especially unqualified black candidates. I would need to do more research before I felt confident about this issue specifically, but it is certainly possible that in the United States, affirmative action is so extreme that it is suboptimal for advancing educational outcomes for minorities.**

[Affirmative Action: What Do We Know?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30162729.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab5df27a45b1892b4eddfe0f728629c58&ab_segments=&origin=)

-   Literature review

-   Mismatch could exist for a subset of especially unqualified black candidates, and the degree to which affirmative action is too much or too little in the US is up for debate.

[Affirmative Action and the Quality-Fit Tradeoff](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20962/w20962.pdf)

-   "The literature clearly shows positive average effects of college quality on a host of outcomes. This suggests that mild racial preferences will have a positive impact on minority outcomes. The issue is whether racial preferences in their current form are so strong that mismatch effects may arise."

-   "As we argue throughout this paper, the net impact of racial preferences come down to whether the strength of the overall college quality effect is larger or smaller than any match effects."

-   "The evidence suggests that racial preferences are so aggressive that reshuffling some African American students to less-selective schools would improve some outcomes due to match effects dominating quality effects. The existing evidence indicates that such match effects may be particularly relevant for first-time bar passage and among undergraduates majoring in STEM fields. However, shifting minority undergraduates to low-resource non-selective schools ultimately may undo any gains from higher match quality, and shifting minorities out of law schools altogether could lead to worse labor market outcomes among these students than had they been admitted to some law school."

**Importantly, mismatch effects presuppose either that students' enrollment decisions are irrational or that selective universities possess private information which affects school performance. There is some evidence for the latter, meaning if we presuppose that the former assertion is true, making such information more public could decrease mismatch effects where they exist.**

[Does affirmative action lead to mismatch? A new test and evidence](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE83)

-   "We argue that once we take into account the students' rational enrollment decisions, mismatch in the sense that the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action admission policies are made worse off ex ante can only occur if selective universities possess private information."

-   "Ex ante mismatch occurs when revelation of this information would have changed the student's choice of school. This necessary condition for mismatch provides the basis for a new test. The test is implemented using data from the Campus Life and Learning Project at Duke University. Evidence shows that Duke does possess private information that is a statistically significant predictor of students' post-enrollment academic performance. Further, this private information is shown to affect the subjective measures of students' satisfaction as well as their persistence in more difficult majors."

**Much of the research above on the subject suggests that the positive effects of affirmative action on minority performance translates into positive labor market effects downstream. There is some research which suggests otherwise, but this suffers from the same problem as another study mentioned before in that it assumes uniform effects of prior performance on future performance for racial groups.**

[Affirmative Action in Higher Education](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2117647.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A42e0ed4c8fa818183614196a852973f5&ab_segments=&origin=)

-   Finds that holding performance constant, blacks gain more in subsequent earnings from attending selective colleges than whites, but this may be offset by performance as a result of affirmative action.

-   Moreover, colleges with a median SAT score above 1100 have no higher returns to education than colleges with one between 1000-1099, meaning that affirmative action may lower black students' earnings if they perform worse in more selective schools.

-   Note: Assumes effects of GPA and SAT on school performance are uniform for races

**In short, it appears that mismatch is not an inherent feature of affirmative action programs although it can occur when such programs are sufficiently extreme. There is little evidence that affirmative action negatively impacts school performance for minorities and the overall evidence suggests it has positive labor market effects for such groups.**

-   Literature review

-   Diversity in colleges and universities are associated with various learning and "democracy" outcomes amongst all race or ethnic groups, although arguments about causality potentially undermine these results, as for example those who are growing intellectually might be more likely to go to diverse spaces as they're more culturally aware.

  <summary>Opinion and Psychology</summary>

**There are many explanatory factors involved in support and opposition to affirmative action. Racial prejudice or concerns about justice can predict opposition. On the other hand, white guilt can predict support.**

[Racial Prejudice and Attitudes Toward Affirmative Action](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111770)

-   Finds that while racial prejudice explains some of the opposition to affirmative action, it doesn't explain all of it, and many whites who strongly resist affirmative action believe in making extra efforts to help African Americans.

[Opposition to Affirmative Action: Racial Affect and Traditional Value Predictors Across Four Programs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1995.tb02394.x)

-   Examines the nature of opposition to affirmative action

-   "Research on white opinions of such compensatory policies as busing and affirmative action has suggested that prejudice is the primary determinant of policy attitudes (Jacobson, 1985; McConahay, 1982). Often, however, racism is measured in a manner that confounds prejudice with values and concerns about justice."

-   "We found that: (a) support varied considerably across programs and was greater when implementation was imminent; (b) separate operationalizations of race prejudice and dispositional justice beliefs accounted for equal, and at times greater, variance in affirmative action opinions relative to a measure of symbolic racism; and (c) correlates of policy endorsement, including dispositional justice beliefs but not racial affect, varied from program to program."

-   "It is also suggested that justice concerns, particularly regarding policy specifics, are important predictors of affirmative action attitudes that to date have largely been overlooked."

[White Guilt: Its Antecedents and Consequences for Attitudes Toward Affirmative Action](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167299025004008)

-   White guilt mediated the relationship from white privilege and beliefs about the prevalence of discrimination to attitudes toward affirmative action, and both white guilt and prejudice independently predicted attitudes toward affirmative action.
