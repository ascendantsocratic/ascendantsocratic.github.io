## Population

[Ward et al. (2014)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr077.pdf) surveyed US adults to determine how many people were gay. 96.6% identified as straight,1.6% identified as gay/lesbian, 0.7% identified as bisexual, and 1.1% either did not know or did not answer.

## Nature/Nurture

There appears to be neurological differences between homosexuals and heterosexuals of the same sex [(Safron et al., 2017;](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep41314)  [Manzouri & Savic, 2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29227002/). GWAS and GWLS research has shown that same-sex sexual behavior has a genetic basis [(Ganna et al., 2019;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7082777/)  [Sanders et al., 2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8604844/). Twin studies have also revealed that same-sex sexual behavior is partly genetic in origin [(Whitam et al., 1993;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01541765)  [Alanko et al., 2010;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19172387/)  [Långström et al., 2010)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18536986/).

### Conversion Therapy

Conversion therapy has been found to be ineffective in altering seuxal orientation without causing harm , being linked to depression, suicidality, anxiety, social isolation, and decreased capacity for intimacy [(Cornell, 2016;](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-whether-conversion-therapy-can-alter-sexual-orientation-without-causing-harm/) [Ryan et al., 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30403564/). According to one large survey, 57% of transgender and non-binary youth who have underwent conversion therapy reported a suicide attempt in the last year, significantly more than that of the gender transgender and non-binary population in general [(Paley, 2019)](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2019/?section=Conversion-Therapy-Change-Attempts), suggesting that conversion therapy efforts are ineffective for LGBT people in general.

This does not mean that it can never work in changing homosexual thoughts and/or behavior, however. In fact, self-reporting amongst "dissatisfied homosexuals" reported that those who underwent conversion therapyh ad decreased in the frequency of homosexual thoughts and fantasies due to their therapy, as well as large improvements in psychological, interpersonal, and spiritual well-being [(Nicolosi & Byrd, 2000)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pr0.2000.86.3c.1071). [Byrd & Nicolosi (2002)](https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/A-meta-analytic-review-of-treatment-of-homosexuality.pdf) also conclused that after meta-analyzing the research on the efficacy of conversion therapy that there was weak evidence that suggested it may be possible to change a person's sexual orientation. However, the APA concludes that *"efforts to change sexual orientation are unlikely to be successful and involve some risk of harm, contrary to the claims of SOCE practitioners and advocates,"* and that *"the population that undergoes SOCE tends to have strongly conservative religious views that lead them to seek to change their sexual orientation"* [(Glassgold et al., 2009)](https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf). Given the selection bias with people who are conservative and anti-gay disproportionately trying to get conversion therapy, it would make sense that some of them would in fact report it working and being positive. But the fact that even amongst this sample most people end up with significant psychological harm suggests that this would be harmful especially for those who don't share conservative views. The result on dissatisfied homosexuals can be understood in this framework as a sample of people who would be susceptible to conversion therapy potentially working even if it doesn't work on the general gay population.

## Well-Being

LGB people are at higher risk of mental disorder, suicidal ideation, substance misuse, suicide attempts, and deliberate self-harm than heterosexuals [(Russell & Joyner, 2001;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446760/)  [Meyer, 2003;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072932/)  [King et al., 2008;](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-8-70)  [Giacomo et al., 2018)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2704490). They tend to have higher prevalence of general poor mental health and low well-being [(Semlyen et al., 2016)](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-0767-z). However, same-sex sexually attracted individuals do not appear to have a disproportionately high completed suicide risk [(Haas et al., 2011)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2011.534038). Much of this is likely due to minority stress caused by stigma, prejudice, and discrimination [(Meyer, 2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072932/). For example, LGBTQ teens are more likely to experience multiple adverse childhood experiences and psychological/physical abuse compared to heterosexual or cisgender peers [(Baams, 2018)](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/141/5/e20173004/37845/Disparities-for-LGBTQ-and-Gender-Nonconforming?redirectedFrom=fulltext). Higher levels of gender nonconformity are in fact associated with a greater likelihood of adversity.

Having nonheterosexual identity, attraction, and behavior are all associated with substance use, with greater risk in women compared to men [(McCabe et al., 2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156552/).

Research suggests that LGB youth populations are at higher risk of homelessness [(Morton et al., 2017)](https://voicesofyouthcount.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ChapinHall_VoYC_NationalReport_Final.pdf). Responses from providers of homeless youth services suggest that sexual and gender minority youth are overrepresented among those experiencing homelessness, face longer periods of homelessness, and encounter more mental and physical health issues [(Choi et al., 2015)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1pd9886n). [Castellanos (2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4930864/) found three distinct pathways in this occurring: some experienced homelessness after disruptions in state care systems, others due to extreme family conflict over their sexual orientation, and most became homeless through long-term family disintegration, where disclosure of homosexuality exacerbated existing conflict.

Research suggests that discrimination, harassment, and bullying in Canadian schools against LGBT youth is very prevalent [(Taylor et al., 2011)](https://winnspace.uwinnipeg.ca/handle/10680/1265). The same study found that students from schools with gay-straight alliances are much more likely to agree that their school communities are supportive of LGBTQ people, are much more likely to be open with some or all of their peers about their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, and are more likely to see their school climate as becoming less homophobic. Bullying experiences amongst LGB people are associated with posttraumatic stress in adulthood [(Rivers, 2004)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Recollections-of-bullying-at-school-and-their-for-Rivers/30346e04ce285342e2ee3d26f57ed78194e9a08e).

### Social Support/Victimization

Victimization has a significant indirect effect on the mental health of gay men [(Puckett et al., 2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5270763/). Victimization is highly prevalent amongst LGB youth with experiences of self-harm and suicide [(Williams et al., 2021)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245268). LGB young adults at the highest risk of attempting suicide and having other health problems are in fact ones who reported a high level of rejection by their families as a result of their sexual orientation [(Ryan et al., 2007;](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Family-Rejection-as-a-Predictor-of-Negative-Health-Ryan-Huebner/dc50daf047dd7992f70cc327631386e350484c01)  [Ryan et al., 2010)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101206093701.htm). A more supportive social environment was significantly associated with fewer suicide attempts for LGB youth, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and other risk factors for suicide attempts [(Hatzenbuehler, 2011)](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/127/5/896/64904/The-Social-Environment-and-Suicide-Attempts-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

### Discrimination

[Sears & Mallory (2014)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9qs0n354) reviewed the literature on sexual orientation and employment discrimination and found that there exists widespread and continuing employment discrimination against LGBT people, which affects them in terms of health, wages, job opportunities, productivity in the workplace, and job satisfaction. Moreover, [(Klawitter, 2014)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irel.12075) used meta-regression analysis and found that sexual orientation even after controlling for measures of work intensity explains the difference between homosexual and heterosexual men in terms of earnings. For women, the evidence is less conclusive. Same-sex borrowers tend to face discrimination in lending practices [(Sun & Gao, 2017)](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/19/9293).

Experimental research suggests that people are less likely to engage in helping behavior towards a person if they are perceived as gay or lesbian compared to if they are perceived as straight [(Hendren & Blank, 2009)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-21801-006).

Homophobes are the most likely to be homosexuals, and homophobia often stems from authoritarian parents [(Bryner, 2012)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/homophobes-might-be-hidden-homosexuals/).

Homophobia has a substantial genetic component to it [(Willmes & Kandler, 2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-017-9884-9).

### Coming Out

Coming out about one's sexual orientation is linked to lower anxiety, more positive affectivity, and higher self esteem, and also correlated with higher levels of social support [(Jordan & Deluty, 2008)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J082v35n02_03). However, social reactions mediated the relationship between identity development and self-disclosure. Concealing one's homosexual identity is linked to a significantly higher incidence of cancer and infectious diseases, at least among gay men [(Kemeny et al., 1996)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0278-6133.15.4.243).

### Sexual Health

LGB men tend to have a disproportionately high number of sexual partners [(Jeffries, 2011;](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/article_files/4315111.pdf)  [Mercer et al., 2016)](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3149-z/tables/2). Gay men are more likely than lesbian women to accept a casual sex offer from other gay/lesbian people [(Matsick et al., 2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-020-01864-y).

Homosexual men are disproportionately likely to have and transmit a number of diseases, including HIV [(Ruiz et al., 2001;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222906/)  [CDC, 2015)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150712231441/https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/index.html), syphilis [(Purcell et al., 2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462414/), and hepatitis A [(Corey & Holmes, 1980)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6243391/). [Purcell et al. (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462414/) found that men who have sex with men scored 38 to 109 times as high on all disease metrics used compared to other men or women. Intestinal parasites are also a particular public health concern in the homosexual community [(Keystone et al., 1980;](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1704818/)  [Abdolrasouli et al., 2009)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19653954/). Homosexual men experience greater all-cause mortality, primarily due to the HIV epidemic [(Cochran & Mays, 2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21493941/).

More negative attitudes toward homosexuality are directly associated with a greater likelihood of unprotected anal sex over the following year. Moreover, lower self-esteem, more anxious symptoms, and childhood sexual abuse are indirectly related to more unprotected anal sex through more sexual partners, sexual encounters, and substance abuse symptoms [(Rosario et al., 2006)](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/aeap.2006.18.5.444). Increased tolerance for homosexuals reduces the HIV rate through causing low-risk men to enter the pool of homosexual partners and causing sexually active men to substitute away from underground, anonymous, and risky behaviors [(Francis & Mialon, 2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629609001441?via%3Dihub). Stigma surrounding LGB men also affects their HIV testing decisions [(Lott et al., 2022)](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-12761-5).

## Policy

### Same-Sex Marriage

Same-sex married couples have a higher suicide rate relative to opposite-sex married couples [(Erlangsen et al., 2019)](https://jech.bmj.com/content/74/1/78). However, research has also suggested that married LGBT adults are healthier and happier than single LGBT adults [(Herek, 2006;](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.61.6.607) [(Eckart, 2017)](https://www.washington.edu/news/2017/04/13/married-lgbt-older-adults-are-healthier-happier-than-singles-study-finds/), which means that marriage likely increases the quality of life of homosexuals even if they still have higher suicidality relative to heterosexuals.

Laws allowing same-sex marriage appear to have general positive health effects. This has been seen with research suggesting positive mental health outcomes of legalizing same-sex marriage [(Raifman et al., 2017a;](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2604258) [Raifman et al., 2017b;](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2643167) [Kennedy et al., 2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33812751/), negative mental health outcomes of banning same-sex marriage [(Berger, 2010)](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/544385), as well as same-sex marriage laws being associated with lower spread of syphilis [(Peng et al., n.a;](https://www.academia.edu/446302/The_Effects_of_Same_Sex_Marriage_Laws_on_Public_Health_and_Welfare) [Francis et al., 2012)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v75y2012i8p1329-1341.html), a proxy for risky homosexual behavior, and lower healthcare use among sexual minorities [(Hatzenbuehler, 2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22390442/). A lot of this likely has to do with increased freedom but it also probably also reflects cultural shifts that emerge following such laws which legitimate same-sex marriage. Moreover, the additional legal and financial rights, benefits, and protections afforded to same-sex couples through legalizing same-sex marriage is another likely culprit for this [(Pawelski et al., 2006)](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/118/1/349/69577/The-Effects-of-Marriage-Civil-Union-and-Domestic).

### Legal Protection

Anti-discrimination and anti-bullying laws appear to increase quality of life for sexual minorities by reducing discrimination and bullying [(Barron & Hebl, 2013;](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-13791-001) [Meyer et al., 2019)](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/LGBT.2018.0194). However, even with anti-discrimination laws, discrimination against sexual minorities can persist.

### Same-Sex Parents

Research on the outcomes of children with same-sex parents compared to heterosexual parents is extremely mixed. [Schumm (2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0033294116665594) found that the research in general is of very poor quality and that more research is needed to accurately establish the relationship. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that if one only considers one-time studies of either young children or children who spent very little time in a same-sex household, one would conclude there is no difference in outcomes. On the other hand, if one looks at longitudinal studies and studies that look at adolescents and young adults, one would conclude there are differences, where same-sex parents have worse outcomes.

Looking at meta-analyses, [Fedewa et al. (2014)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1550428X.2013.869486) finds that children raised by same-gender parents have better psychological adjustment and no differences in cognitive development. [Crowl et al. (2007)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15504280802177615) finds that children raised by same-sex parents fare equally well. Finally, [Schofield (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336288130_Knowing_what_we_don%27t_know_A_meta-analysis_of_children_raised_by_gay_or_lesbian_parents) found several negative associations between living with gay or lesbian parents and several outcomes. It seems that the research on this issue is not completely settled.

## Child Abuse

**A common talking point in anti-gay circles is that homosexuals (particularly men) are more likely to molest children.**

It is important to recognize distinctions between different groups of people who could reasonably be considered "homosexual men". There are men who are attracted to mature members of the same sex, and there are men who are just attracted to the same sex in general. If we use the latter definition, homosexuals are more likely to engage in child molestation when compared to those who are just attracted to the opposite sex in general, as a disproportionate number of men who engage in child molestation do it to male children [(Freund & Watson, 2010)](http://www.robinjwilson.com/articles/Freund%20&%20Watson%20(1992)%20proportions.pdf).

However, if we restrict our definition to the former, men who are attracted to mature members of the same sex, they are no more likely to molest children than men who are attracted to mature members of the opposite sex. Such groups display similar levels of sexual attraction to children, which is to say very little [(Kurt et al., 1989;](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-33271-001) [Herek, 2018)](https://lgbpsychology.org/html/facts_molestation.html). Moreover, amongst children who were sexually abused, the proportion that report their abuser was homosexual is within the range of the proportion of homosexuals in the general population [(Jenny et al., 1994)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8008535/). Given that most attacks on the homosexual community come from those who claim that, for example, gay married men are more likely to molest children than straight married men, it is reasonable to simply assert that homosexuals are not more likely to engage in child abuse, as they are incorrect in that assertion even if under some definitions the fact is true.
