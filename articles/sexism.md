## Bias

### Anti-Male Bias

Although men do tend to be seen as more favorable in terms of agency stereotyping [(Eagly et al., 2019)](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-amp0000494.pdf), attitudes and stereotypes either tend to be equal for men and women or favor women over men, with there being a larger female advantage in communion-related stereotyping and equality in competence [(Eagly & Mladinic, 1989;](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167289154008?journalCode=pspc)  [Eagly et al., 1991;](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00792.x)  [Fiebert & Meyer, 2010;](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223989709603527)  [Eagly et al., 2019)](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-amp0000494.pdf).

Generally speaking it is only those gaps which favor men that are discussed. Disparities exist in various areas where men are disadvantaged, such as health and longevity, crime and violence, domestic relations, or education. Moreover, in the workplace, men are far more likely than women to be killed and to work long hours. These are ignored while gaps which disadvantage women are emphasized [(Browne, 2013)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2311459). This has been shown in survey data where gender disparities in health, early education, and domestic roles are ignored [(Block et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103118304633?via%3Dihub). This asymmetry in support for social action towards change is predicted by beliefs about what the ideal gender representation should be and the perceived causes of gender imbalances in each career type. Importantly, gender representation in careers and not in salary appears to be the key factor underlying this discrepancy. This seems to imply a reinforcement of gender roles in the selective discussion of gender disparities, where women are expected to act like men in some ways, but men aren't expected to act like women. Another study which examines a similar area is [Stewart-Williams & Thomas (2020)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334751470_Reactions_to_Male-Favouring_vs_Female-Favouring_Sex_Differences_A_Preregistered_Experiment_and_Southeast_Asian_Replication), which finds that people react less positively to male-favoring differences than female-favoring differences, judging them as less important and less credible. This suggests there is a protective fragility of women over men in terms of gender relations.

### Media Representation

Research suggests that men in the media today are overwhelmingly portrayed as negative, being frequently associated with violence and aggression. With the exception of a small minority of positive media portrayals of male heroes such as war veterans, firefighters, and rescuers, and portrayals of men as good fathers, husbands, and citizens, the only males presented positively are men and boys who have been feminized [(Macnamara, 2006)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230625679_7). Women's violence is more likely to be reported as irrational or emotional, while men's violence is more likely to be presented as normal or rational [(Naylor, 2001)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1468-2311.00200). Articles depicting men with mental illnesses are significantly more likely to have stigmatizing content and violence as themes. Articles depicting mentally ill women are significantly more likely to quote mental health experts, discuss mental health interventions, and have recovery and inadequate resources as themes [(Whitley et al., 2015)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00127-014-0902-4).

## Economics

### Housing

**Men are disproportionately discriminated against in terms of housing, due to preferences rather than statistical discrimination. This suggests that these are irrational and unjust biases rather than justified actions undertaken by rental agents.**

[Ethnic and Gender Discrimination in Rental Housing Market: Evidence from Meta-Analysis of Correspondence Tests, 2006-2017](https://crese.univ-fcomte.fr/uploads/wp/WP-2018-04.pdf)

-   Meta-analysis and literature review of 25 studies in OECD countries from 2006-2017

-   Finds that discrimination in the rental housing market is against men and minorities.

-   This discrimination mainly comes from agents' preferences rather than statistical discrimination

-   Real estate agents discriminate significantly less minority applicants than private landlords do.

-   This is discrimination in the form of being chosen by real estate agents or private landlords

### Workplace

Over time, as women have increasingly entered high-status occupations, occupations' people-things orientation became an increasingly strong predictor of women's participation in occupations [(Lippa et al., 2014)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095960). Men tend to show interest in more scientific occupations, while women tend to show interest in more social occupations [(Carter & Strong, 1933;](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1934-01297-001)  [Morris, 2016;](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27505283/)  [Mozahem et al., 2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21683603.2018.1521759). This is in part due to differences in sex hormones, which affect a person's things-people orientation [(Beltz et al., 2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166361/).

Experimental research on hiring discrimination finds that there exists high levels of discrimination against men applying to female jobs [(Rich, 2014)](https://ftp.iza.org/dp8584.pdf), which outweighs all other gender based discrimination effects [(Ahmed et al., 2021)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245513), with bias in male-dominated occupations being null [(Baert, 2015;](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282895214_Field_Experimental_Evidence_on_Gender_Discrimination_in_Hiring_Biased_as_Heckman_and_Siegelman_Predicted)  [Birkelund et al., 2022)](https://academic.oup.com/esr/article/38/3/337/6412759?login=false) or slightly in favor of males [(Hangartner et al., 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03136-0).

Research suggests that gender quotas on the corporate boards of directors reduce company profitability and financial performance [(Yu & Madison, 2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecaf.12487). While it is not clear what the causality is of this effect, this evidence suggests that at the very least gender quotas do not have a positive effect on company financial performance. [Solal & Snellman. (2019)](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/876846) found that one additional woman on a board of directors for a company results in a 2.3% decrease in the company's market value on average. This is argued to be because a company with a gender-diverse board of directors is interpreted by shareholders as revealing a preference for diversity over market performance, as opposed to more women actually harming the company. The perceptions of women in boards, as opposed to their actual performance in boards, determines the market value.

### Gender Paradox

[Stoet & Geary (2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797617741719) found that girls performed similarly to or better than boys in science in most countries, although the sex differences in the magnitude of relative academic strengths and pursuit of STEM degrees rose with increases in national gender equality. They hypothesized from this that life-quality pressures in less gender-equal countries prompt girls' and women's engagement with STEM subjects. This study however fails replication when using other measures of the same variables used [(Richardson & Bruch, 2020)](https://www.genderscilab.org/blog/gender-equality-paradox-monkey-business-or-how-to-tell-spurious-causal-stories-about-nation-level-achievement-by-women-in-stem), suggesting there may be no effect of gender equality on differences in the pursuit of STEM degrees. While the theory posited in the original study is undermined by the study's failure to replicate, these findings are still consistent with a biological explanation for gender inequality, as even in the case of there being no relationship between convergence of academic strengths and STEM enrollment it would imply that women simply lack interest in doing STEM careers regardless of their relative academic attainment.

[Isungset et al. (2021)](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e5wjk/) finds that as gender equality has increased over the 20th century the heritability of lifetime income has also increased. Given that lifetime income is correlated substantially by educational level and type of education, we can use this as a proxy for the heritability of pursuit of STEM careers over time. Using this would suggest that the heritability of pursuit of STEM careers has increased over time, even though convergence in general academics between men and women has not produced a convergence in STEM career pursuit, pointing to a genetic cause for sex differences in pursuit of STEM. A genetic explanation for gender differences in STEM is consistent with research suggesting that said gender differences are influenced by noncognitive traits, behaviors, and interests [(Delaney & Devereux, 2021)](https://oxfordre.com/economics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.001.0001/acrefore-9780190625979-e-663). It should be noted however that [Isungset et al. (2021)](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e5wjk/) also pointed out that the heritability of lifetime income was still lower for women than for men, suggesting that environmental factors such as discrimination could still play a significant role in gender inequalities, even if they have decreased over time.

Attempting to counter a biological explanation for gender inequality, [Breda et al. (2020)](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/49/31063) finds that the stereotype associating math to men is stronger in more egalitarian and developed countries, and is strongly associated with various measures of female underrepresentation in math-intensive fields. Therefore, the gender paradox if it exists is instead due to the reassertion of gender stereotypes occurring as societies become more gender equal. Economic development reshapes rather than suppresses gender norms, with an emergence of new or more forms of social differentiation across genders. However, the causality of this isn't clear. It may for instance be the case that people are observing the biological reality that women aren't attending STEM careers in spite of increased gender equality and forming those stereotypes as a consequence of that initial observation. Thus, this isn't inconsistent with biological explanations for gender inequality.

## Education

### School Punishment

**There exists gender gaps in school punishment which unfairly harm boys even after controlling for identical behavior. This occurs for both corporal punishment and other discipline practices.**

**Corporal punishment broadly speaking is the use of physical force as a means of punishment for an infraction. There is a gender gap which disadvantages boys with regards to corporal punishment in schools. This exists even after controlling for severity and frequency of punishable behaviors, and persists even in places where it is banned.**

[A Systematic Review of Corporal Punishment in Schools: Global Prevalence and Correlates](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1524838020925787)

-   Systematic review of 53 papers

-   Finds that school corporal punishment is prevalent worldwide including where bans are in place, and does not appear to be decreasing over time.

-   It is associated with physical, academic, mental health, and behavioral problems for children

-   Boys, black students (in the US), and students exposed to violence at home were most at risk of corporal punishment

-   Schools with high rates of other disciplinary practices were more likely to use corporal punishment, while those who employed a mental health professional and trained staff in safety procedures were less likely to use corporal punishment.

-   Teacher attitudes favoring corporal punishment, and their use of violence in other contexts, increased risk

-   Low SES of the student or school environment increased risk, while high levels of state social capital reduced risk.

[RACE AND GENDER BIAS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF CORPORAL PUNISHMENT ](https://www.mcgill.ca/connectionslab/files/connectionslab/spr193shaw_0.pdf)

-   After controlling for severity and frequency of punishable behaviors, there was a statistically significant relationship between gender and corporal punishment

[Corporal Punishment: Used in a Discriminatory Manner?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00098655.1991.9955892)

-   Finds gender bias in corporal punishment

**For the possible exception of preschools, boys are in general disciplined more than girls even after controlling for the type of infraction. These punishments however vary by the gendered nature of the behavior. Boys are punished more for aggressive behavior, while girls are punished more for attendance and dress code.**

[Gender Inequities in High School Discipline Practices](https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/44558k98w)

-   "The results showed a clear inequity between the genders, in that boys and girls were more rigidly disciplined in the stereotypical behaviors of their gender, with boys receiving more referrals with aggressive behaviors and girls being cited more readily for referrals for attendance and dress code."

[Parsing Disciplinary Disproportionality: Contributions of Infraction, Student, and School Characteristics to Out-of-School Suspension and Expulsion](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.923.5562&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

-   "Type of infraction; race, gender, and to a certain extent socioeconomic status at the individual level; and, at the school level, mean school achievement, percentage Black enrollment, and principal perspectives all contributed to the probability of out-of-school suspension or expulsion."

**There was one study which looked at recommendations of preschool expulsions and suspensions, and found no gender disparity. I suspect the reason for this is due to the visual and possibly social differences between boys and girls being relatively minimal at an early age and becoming more exaggerated over time, allowing for over-extending biases to manifest as children age.**

[Do Early Educators' Implicit Biases Regarding Sex and Race Relate to Behavior Expectations and Recommendations of Preschool Expulsions and Suspensions?](https://www.researchconnections.org/childcare/resources/32604)

-   "No differences were found based on recommendations regarding suspension or expulsion, except that Black teachers in general recommended longer periods of disciplinary exclusion regardless of child gender/race. Recommendations for future research and policy regarding teacher training are offered."

## Healthcare

There exists a gender bias in research [(Holdcroft, 2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1761670/). Research funding disproportionately goes into dealing with male medical issues. Early clinical trials until 1994 mostly excluded women for safety reasons which led to it being reported in 2005 that eight out of ten prescription drugs were withdrawn from the US market because of women's health issues. Women more recently have not been recruited much into trail results, in part because women using hormonal contraception must be considered a separate analytical group, a study requirement which creates access burdens for women. Researchers and ethics committees ignored risks of contraceptives, interference with drug metabolism by hormonal contraception, that partners may be sterile, that fetal harm may also affect men, that the risk of fetal exposure to one dose of a drug was minimal and that women could make their own decisions. There is also a lack of insorportion of gender data into evidence-based medicine, with often a lack of gender specific management guidelines.

## Criminal Justice

### Arrest and Policing Bias

**All else equal, men are more likely to be arrested, are more aggressively policed on average than women, and are more likely to have force initiated on them. Some of these results when tested have been found to be robust to publication bias, and these results are consistently found in a variety of studies. Women appear to be held to much lower standards by police in a variety of circumstances.**

[The Effects of Suspect Characteristics on Arrest: A Meta-Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235214000890)

-   Meta-analysis on the effect of suspect characteristics on arrest

-   Finds that black individuals, males, and hispanic individuals were significantly more likely to be arrested than white individuals, females, and non-Hispanic individuals

-   These effects persisted across the majority of moderator categories.

-   "The findings with regard to gender here show that men are being treated more harshly now than they were in the 1960's through the 1980's. The moderator analysis showed that gender was significant for studies using data from the 1990's and the 2000's, but not in earlier studies. This appears to be the opposite of what was found by the analysis conducted by Bontrager and her colleagues. The gender findings presented here seem to suggest that the system may in fact be loosely coupled."

[Selective Responses to Threat: The Roles of Race and Gender in Decisions to Shoot](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.848.1523&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

-   Finds that using computerized simulation, people were biased away from shooting white female suspects in favor of shooting white male suspects.

-   White participants were biased toward shooting black men but biased away from shooting black women and white ingroup members.

[Examining the influence of drivers' characteristics during traffic stops with police: Results from a national survey](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418820400095741)

-   Finds that young black and hispanic males are at increased risk for citations, searches, arrests, and uses of force after other extralegal and legal characteristics are controlled.

-   However, they weren't any more likely to have been carrying contraband

[The Impact of Implicit Stereotyping on Offender Profiling: Unexpected Results From an Observational Study of Shoplifting](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Volkan-Topalli/publication/247744878_The_Impact_of_Implicit_Stereotyping_on_Offender_ProfilingUnexpected_Results_From_an_Observational_Study_of_Shoplifting/links/00b49534d42678e6fd000000/The-Impact-of-Implicit-Stereotyping-on-Offender-ProfilingUnexpected-Results-From-an-Observational-Study-of-Shoplifting.pdf)

-   Finds that looking at shoplifting, when trained observers were allowed to deviate from a clearly specified random selection protocol, oversampled shoppers on the basis of race, gender, and perceived age, beyond the degree to which profiling could be rationally justified to be engaged with.

[Gender and Racial/Ethnic Differences in Criminal Justice Decision Making in Intimate Partner Violence Cases](https://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables12.Revised.pdf)

-   Finds that men are disproportionately arrested and prosecuted compared to women in a variety of areas, and in ways that are not accounted for by differential circumstances.

[Sex differences in the likelihood of arrest](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235204000637?via%3Dihub)

-   "Controlling for offense seriousness and a variety of other factors, logistic regression results showed that the probability of arrest for females was 28 percent lower for kidnapping, 48 percent lower for forcible fondling, 9 percent lower for simple assault, and 27 percent lower for intimidation than for males."

-   "Overall, these findings suggest that the lower arrest rate for females is partly the result of leniency shown to women by law enforcement personnel."

-   Even after controlling for publication bias there exists a gender disparity in the likelihood of use of force by police officers after controls are included 

[Does the Criminal Justice System Treat Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Offenders Leniently?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418820701485601)

-   "We examine whether men who physically assault their female partners or who commit sexual assault receive more lenient treatment than offenders who commit other types of assaults. Analyses of the National Violence Against Women Survey do not support these hypotheses. Rather, they suggest that women who assault their male partners are particularly likely to avoid arrest."

### Sentencing

**Sentencing judgements and related court activities, such as the death penalty, all appear to favor women over men even when controlling for relevant factors. This holds for all kinds of crimes, including murder, sexual offenses, drug offenses, and more. These effects are much more consistent than racial effects in sentencing. Cases involving a female victim are more likely to result in a harsher sentence, and this effect is especially bad when the defendant is male.**

[The Effects of Physical Attractiveness, Race, Socioeconomic Status, and Gender of Defendants and Victims on Judgments of Mock Jurors: A Meta-Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1994.tb01552.x)

-   Meta-analysis of experimental research on mock juror judgements

-   Finds that in general, it was better for defendants to be physically attractive, female, and of high SES, although these advantages were nil for some crimes.

-   There were no overall effects of race on judgements, but the effect of race on punishment was strongly moderated by type of crime

-   Effects of victim characteristics on judgements were generally inconsequential, although defendants were at a disadvantage when the victim was female.

[Gender Judgments: An Investigation of Gender Differentiation in Sentencing and Remand in New Zealand](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/35464079.pdf)

-   "In all but one case (the imprisonment sentencing decision), sex continued to impact directly on the judicial outcomes investigated (length of imprisonment term, remand status, length of custodial remand, bail conditions). That is, sex differences in variables previously found to be influential (i.e. seriousness of criminal history, length of custodial remand, pre-sentencing recommendations) failed fully to explain why women's judicial outcomes were generally less severe than men's."

-   "With other factors statistically controlled, women's imprisonment terms remained substantially shorter than men's."

-   "Sex-based disparity at the point of sentencing (length of imprisonment term and the decision to imprison) was also found to be affected by gendered decision-making earlier in the judicial process which, at least to some degree, impacted on final sentence."

[From Initial Appearance to Sentencing: Do Female Defendants Experience Disparate Treatment?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235215000665)

-   "In general, it was found that females were treated more leniently by the court system, although specific groups of female defendants were found to experience cumulative disadvantage across the criminal court system."

[Does Victim Gender Increase Sentence Severity? Further Explorations of Gender Dynamics and Sentencing Outcomes](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011128703256265)

-   "Using data for offenders convicted of three violent crimes in the seven largest metro counties in Texas in 1991, the authors find evidence that offenders who victimized females received substantially longer sentences than offenders who victimized males. Results also show that victim gender effects on sentence length are conditioned by offender gender, such that male offenders who victimize females received the longest sentence of any other victim gender/offender gender combination. However, whereas these effects are observed for sentence length, no victim gender effects are observed on whether offenders received an incarcerative or nonincarcerative sentence."

[Gender Differences in Criminal Sentencing: Do Effects Vary Across Violent, Property, and Drug Offenses?](https://scholarworks.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=gang_lee)

-   "We find that the effect of gender on sentencing does vary by crime type, but not in a consistent or predicted fashion. For both property and drug offending, females are less likely to be sentenced to prison and also receive shorter sentences if they are sentenced to prison. For violent offending, however, females are no less likely than males to receive prison time, but for those who do, females receive substantially shorter sentences than males."

-   "We conclude that such variation in the gender-sentencing association across crime type is largely due to features of Texas' legal code that channel the level of discretion available to judges depending on crime type and whether incarceration likelihood or sentence length is examined."

[The Gender Gap in Sex Offender Punishment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-019-09416-x)

-   "male sex offenders are more likely to be sentenced to prison, and given longer terms, than female sex offenders. Findings are similar across sex offense severity and whether the offense involved a minor victim."

[The Impact of Gender and Race-Ethnicity in the Pretrial Release Process](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2004.51.2.222?seq=1)

-   Women are more likely to get pretrial police relative to men, even after controlling for prior record and offense conduct.

[Gender and Sentencing of Drug Offenders: Is Chivalry Dead?](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/088740349900900305)

-   "The results of our analysis reveal that females are significantly less likely than males to be sentenced to prison."

[Sex effects and sentencing: An analysis of the statistical literature](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418829500092601#:~:text=Sex%20effects%20and%20sentencing:%20An%20analysis%20of%20the,composition,%20and%20to%20conceptual%20dimensions%20of%20the%20research).

-   "In comparison with Kleck's review of race and sentencing, sex effects favoring women are far more frequent than race effects favoring whites. Results from the weighted sample suggest that sex effects are evident in both recent and older data sets and in both recent and earlier published work. They are more likely to emerge in analyses of felony offenses, in offenses prosecuted in felony courts, in courts in urban areas, and in the decision to incarcerate rather than in the length of an incarceration sentence."

[Chivalry is Not Dead: Murder, Gender, and the Death Penalty](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1767508)

-   "In cases involving single victims, the results were striking. In gang murders, the death sentence rate was less than one-tenth the overall death sentence rate. By contrast, in rape murder cases, the death sentence rate was nine times the overall death sentence rate. The death sentence rate for single-victim domestic violence murders was roughly 25% lower than the overall death sentence rate. We also examined, through this study and earlier California studies, more general data on gender disparities in death sentencing and found substantial gender-of-defendant and gender-of-victim disparities. Women guilty of capital murder are far less likely than men to be sentenced to death, and defendants who kill women are far more likely to be sentenced to death than defendants who kill men. We argue that all of these findings are consistent with chivalric norms, and we conclude that, in the prosecutors' decisions to seek death and juries' decisions to impose it, chivalry appears to be alive and well."

## Politics

**Women perform just as well when they run for public office, but there is a gender gap in political ambition. This is due to a combination of women being less likely to be encouraged or recruited for office, and that public office careers have traits which women tend to find undesirable.**

[Men Rule The Continued Under-Representation of Women in U.S. Politics](https://www.american.edu/spa/wpi/upload/2012-men-rule-report-web.pdf)

-   When women run for public office, they perform just as well as men, but they remain severely under-represented still

-   This is because they don't run for office

-   There is a substantial gender gap in political ambition.

-   Finds that this holds regardless of age, partisan affiliation, income and profession

-   This is due to several factors:

-   Women are less likely to than men to be willing to endure the rigors of a political campaign

-   They are less likely to be recruited to run for office

-   They are less likely to have the freedom to reconcile work and family obligations with a political career

-   They are less likely to think they are qualified

-   They are less likely to perceive a fair political environment

-   Women are less likely to receive the suggestion to run for public office

### Political Quotas

**I am generally for a gender quota in political office, to help increase representation of women to be more proportional to men than is the case currently in most if not all political offices. Quotas have neutral to positive effects on the quality of politicians, and they normalize women getting into politics.**

**Gender quotas can take several forms. They can be reserved seats in political office, they can be quotas for candidates on ballots, or they can be voluntary quotas for candidates in political parties.**

[GENDER QUOTAS DATABASE](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/quotas)

-   The core idea behind gender quotas in politics is to ensure representation of women in politics. There are three major ways in which this is done:

-   Reserved seats (constitutional and/or legislative)

-   Legal candidate quotas (constitutional and/or legislative)

-   Political party quotas (voluntary)

-   These can ensure women make up 20, 30, 40, or 50% of the body in question

**These quotas increase the representation of women within politics.**

[Making Quotas Work: The Effect of Gender Quota Laws On the Election of Women](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3162/036298009787500330)

-   "My results show that quotas that require more women to be on party ballots lead to the election of more women, independent of placement mandates and enforcement mechanisms, but rules governing where female candidates are listed on the ballot and sanctions for noncompliance amplify that effect. Candidate quotas can increase women's representation, but the quotas' effectiveness depends on their design."

**Under such quota systems, the experience and decision-making ability of the candidates, primarily in terms of education, is the same if not better. This is because mediocre male politicians are pushed out of offices as a result of quotas.**

[Quotas and Qualifications in Uganda](https://academic.oup.com/book/6058/chapter/149497081)

-   "The statistical data suggests that, on the vast majority of measures, quota women do not differ significantly from other MPs. Indeed, on some indicators they appear to be better prepared for office than non-quota legislators. The evidence thus demonstrates that quotas have not advanced women that are less qualified or more elite than other MPs."

-   "The slightly different profiles of men and women politicians reflect wider barriers to women's political careers that would not have been overcome without the parity law. Once women are elected, the volume of activity shows no evidence of being gendered, suggesting that women are as effective in the job as men. These findings imply that sex is a barrier to entry but not to performance, reinforcing claims for the use of quotas to overcome entry barriers and negating claims that quotas produce second-rate parliamentarians."

[Gender Quotas and the Crisis of the Mediocre Man: Theory and Evidence from Sweden](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160080)

-   "We ask how competence was affected by a zipper quota, requiring local parties to alternate men and women on the ballot, implemented by the Social Democratic Party in 1993. Far from being at odds with meritocracy, this quota raised the competence of male politicians where it raised female representation the most. We argue that resignation of mediocre male leaders was a key driver of this effect."

[Gender quotas and the quality of politicians](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272714001480)

-   "We analyze the effects of the introduction of gender quotas in candidate lists on the quality of elected politicians, as measured by the average number of years of education."

-   "We find that gender quotas are associated with an increase in the quality of elected politicians, with the effect ranging from 0.12 to 0.24 years of education. This effect is due not only to the higher number of elected women, who are on average more educated than men, but also to the lower number of low-educated elected men. The positive effect on quality is confirmed when we measure the latter with alternative indicators, it persists in the long run and it is robust to controlling for political ideology and political competition."

**Gender quotas help to normalize women in politics, having a cultural effect separate from the policy itself, helping to get more women into office through increasing the interest of potential female candidates and increasing the number of people who vote for female candidates.**

[Powerful Women: Does Exposure Reduce Bias?](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/124/4/1497/1917190)

-   "After ten years of quotas, women are more likely to stand for, and win, elected positions in councils required to have a female chief councilor in the previous two elections. We provide experimental and survey evidence on one channel of influence---changes in voter attitudes. Prior exposure to a female chief councilor improves perceptions of female leader effectiveness and weakens stereotypes about gender roles in the public and domestic spheres."

**Female legislators tend to place higher emphasis on women's issues and children/family concerns, but also on general economic and health issues. They are more likely to cause increases in government expenditures towards public health and decreases in government expenditures towards military and other areas.**

[Still Supermadres? Gender and the Policy Priorities of Latin American Legislators](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00202.x)

-   "I argue that sex role changes in Latin America over the past 35 years have led to changes in how female legislators perceive their political roles, and consequently, changes in their attitudes and behavior. Specifically, female legislators will place higher priority than male legislators on women's issues and children/family concerns, but their attitudes in other areas, such as education, health, the economy, agriculture, and employment, will be similar. However, I expect that gender dynamics in the legislative arena lead to marginalization of women such that gender differences will emerge for bill initiation behavior where they did not appear for attitudes. I test this using a survey of legislators' issue preferences and archival data on the bills that legislators sponsor and find statistical support for the hypotheses."

[Quota Shocks: Electoral Gender Quotas and Government Spending Priorities Worldwide](http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1246248/FULLTEXT01)

-   "We find that substantial quota shocks - those associated with a large increase in women's parliamentary representation - are followed by increased government expenditures towards public health. Further, we find that increases in health spending are offset by relative decreases in military spending and other spending categories. Our findings provide strong evidence that quota policies influence government priorities in historically feminized policy areas, but principally when they are complied with and have substantial numerical consequences."
