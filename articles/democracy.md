## Economic Growth

**There is very clearly a positive correlation between democracy and economic growth. However, there is a lot of debate about the causal direction, if there is a causal relationship at all. I would need to examine this question further to form a stronger opinion on it, although a lot of the mechanisms discussed below in studies for how democracy causes economic growth seem intuitively correct to me. It is clear that while the precise economic effects of democracy have not been determined, it is very unlikely that democracy has negative effects on economic growth. In order to even begin to establish such a relationship, it would first need to be shown that there was a negative correlation between democracy and economic growth, and the existing evidence suggests the exact reverse.**

[Democracy and Economic Growth: A Meta-Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00299.x)

-   "It applies meta-regression analysis to the population of 483 estimates derived from 84 studies on democracy and growth. Using traditional meta-analysis estimators, the bootstrap, and Fixed and Random Effects meta-regression models, it derives several robust conclusions. Taking all the available published evidence together, it concludes that democracy does not have a direct impact on economic growth. However, democracy has robust, significant, and positive indirect effects through higher human capital, lower inflation, lower political instability, and higher levels of economic freedom. Democracies may also be associated with larger governments and less free international trade. There also appear to be country- and region-specific democracy-growth effects. Overall, democracy's net effect on the economy does not seem to be detrimental."

[Democracy Does Cause Growth](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/700936)

-   "Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."

[How often do dictators have positive economic effects? Global evidence, 1858--2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984317308093)

-   "Supposedly well-intentioned dictators are often cited as drivers of economic growth. We examine this claim in a panel of 133 countries from 1858 to 2010. Using annual data on economic growth, political regimes, and political leaders, we document a robust asymmetric pattern: growth-positive autocrats (autocrats whose countries experience larger-than-average growth) are found only as frequently as would be predicted by chance. In contrast, growth-negative autocrats are found significantly more frequently."

-   "Implementing regression discontinuity designs (RDD), we also examine local trends in the neighbourhood of the entry into power of growth-positive autocrats. We find that growth under supposedly growth-positive autocrats does not significantly differ from previous realizations of growth, suggesting that even the infrequent growth-positive autocrats largely "ride the wave" of previous success. On the other hand, our estimates reject the null hypothesis that growth-negative rulers have no effects."

[DEMOCRACY AND GLOBALIZATION](https://0x0.la/u/fcovCUN.pdf)

-   "Our findings support the existence of positive relationships between democracy and globalization."

[DEMOCRACY, GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: THEORY AND EVIDENCE](http://www.columbia.edu/~flr9/documents/Rivera-Batiz_Democracy_Governance_Growth.pdf)

-   "Empirical evidence is presented showing that democracy is in fact a significant determinant of total factor productivity (TFP) growth between 1960 and 1990 in a cross-section of countries. But this contribution occurs only insofar as democratic institutions are associated with greater quality of governance."

##IMAGE

-   "Is there any evidence that democracy is only good for already developed economies? The answer is no. Though we do find that democratizations are associated with larger increases in GDP per capita in countries with higher levels of secondary schooling, there is no evidence that democracy is bad for economic growth in low-income economies or even in economies with low levels of schooling."

-   "So why does democracy increase growth? Our strategy is not well-suited to disentangling particular mechanisms, but we attempt to disaggregate both dimensions of democracy and proximate determinants of growth. When we disentangle what components of democracy matter the most for growth, we find that civil liberties are what seem to be the most important. We also find positive effects of democracy on economic reforms, private investment, the size and capacity of government, and a reduction in social conflict. Clearly all of these are channels by which democracy can increase economic growth, and a great deal of further research is needed. Together with our previous work showing that democracy had no effect on inequality, these results suggest the interaction between democratic institutions and the level and distribution of income is more complex than the previous literature suggests."

[The Political Economy of Growth: Democracy and Human Capital](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-5907.00023)

-   "We conduct statistical investigations into the direct and indirect effects of democracy on growth using a data set consisting of a 30-year panel of 128 countries. We find that democracy has no statistically significant direct effect on growth. Rather, we discover that the effect of democracy is largely indirect through increased life expectancy in poor countries and increased secondary education in nonpoor countries."

[Democracy, Political Stability and Economic Growth](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/democracy-political-stability-and-economic-growth/1630FBD0E7690CAF595EE9C612E405AE)

-   "The results indicate that democracy has a positive indirect effect upon growth through its impacts on the probabilities of both regime change and constitutional government change from one ruling party to another. In addition, the evidence indicates that the two kinds of political change mentioned above have significant and opposite effects on growth; that growth has a negative effect on regime change and a positive effect on the probability of the ruling party remaining in power; and that long-run economic growth tends to exert a positive effect upon democracy."

[Development First, Democracy Later? Or Democracy First, Development Later? The Controversy over Development and Democracy](https://www.democracy.uci.edu/files/docs/conferences/grad/chen.pdf)

-   "in the process of democratization economic development varies from stage to stage: it declines in the early phrase, but increases in the later; investigating economic change corresponding to political transition is critical to reconsider the causality between development and democracy. Lastly, I conclude that the controversy over development and democracy is inconclusive and will be continuing."

[ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND DEMOCRACY](https://scholar.harvard.edu/jrobinson/files/jr_econdevelopment.pdf)

-   "There are two major findings in this literature. First, studies that estimate models of the level of democracy on income per capita find that, other things equal, higher income per capita is associated with greater democracy. Representative studies using only cross-sectional data include those of Jackman (1973), Bollen & Jackman (1985), and Muller (1995). When this literature uses both time-series and cross-sectional variation, with the exception of Londregan & Poole (1996), it pools the data together (see Burkhart & Lewis-Beck 1994 for an innovative example). The second finding, stemming from Przeworski & Limongi (1997), is that once we use a dichotomous definition of democracy and distinguish movements toward democracy from movements toward dictatorships, we find that income per capita does not cause democratization, but it does lead democracies to become consolidated (reduces the probability that a country will experience a coup)."

[ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND DEMOCRACY](https://scholar.harvard.edu/jrobinson/files/jr_econdevelopment.pdf)

-   "Neither does it support the idea that economic development influences the probability of coups but not democratizations. More likely, and in line with the model I develop, income per capita and democracy are correlated because the same features of a society simultaneously determine how prosperous and how democratic it is. There is still a lot to learn on this topic."
