## Returns to Education

According to [Abel & Deitz (2019)](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/06/despite-rising-costs-college-is-still-a-good-investment/), the average annual rate of return for a college bachelor's degree, in spite of rising college costs, is around 14%, meaning it is still a good investment. Research suggests that there is large variation depending on a number of factors. While college selectivity and where one studies has relatively little effect on a person's long-term financial returns to their education [(Mueller, 1988;](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00992285)  [Dale & Krueger, 2002)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1162/003355302320935089), what a person studies has a large effect on their financial returns [(The Economist, 2015)](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/03/12/it-depends-what-you-study-not-where).

## Homeschooling

There are a variety of reasons why parents and youth may decide to do homeschooling, including increasing family bonding, to accomplish more academically, to customize or individualize the curriculum and learning environment, to provide a safer environment, or to teach and impart a particular set of values, beliefs, or worldview.The home-educated tend to score above average on achievement tests regardless of their parents' level of formal education and also score above average on SAT and ACT tests. The home-educated typically do above average on measures of social, emotional, and psychological development and tend to engage more in civic life in adulthood. The causality of these relationships is not clear however [(Ray, 2015)](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED556234.pdf).

## Schooling and Crime

**Improved schooling reduces crime rates. The causal link does not appear to be the reverse, as this was researched using randomized treatment, thus in effect acting as an experiment.**

[Better Schools, Less Crime?](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12308135/Deming_BSLC_QJE.pdf?sequence=1)

-   Finds that moving to a better school through a randomized school choice program predicts lower crime rates among such individuals

## Effects of Class Size

**Class size increases educational attainment even controlling for IQ.**

[Meta-analysis of research on class size and achievement](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.2307/1164099)

-   Meta-analysis

-   Finds that school class size increases educational attainment, across school subjects and even after controlling for IQ

-   This relationship is seen most clearly in well-controlled studies in which pupils were randomly assigned to classes of different sizes

## Performance-Related Pay

**Performance-related pay positively affects student test scores, especially those which were group-based as opposed to individual-based.**

[Does teacher merit pay affect student test scores?](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/does-teacher-merit-pay-affect-student-test-scores)

-   Meta-analysis

-   Finds that teacher merit pay positively affects student test scores and increases teacher retention and recruitment

-   Teacher merit pay programs which included group incentives produced significantly larger effects
