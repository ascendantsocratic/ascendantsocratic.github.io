## Physical

Physical sex differences are small but noticeable at birth, and increase significantly during puberty due to differences in testosterone [(Wells, 2007;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521690X07000371?via%3Dihub)  [Loomba-Albrecht & Styne, 2009)](https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/Abstract/2009/02000/Effect_of_puberty_on_body_composition.4.aspx). Sex differences for muscle power are significant even when height, weight, and age are controlled for [(Gursoy, 2010)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pms.110.3.714-720) and athletic differences are so large that top level high school boys are better in athletics than top level olympic women in a variety of areas [(Boys vs Women, n.a.)](https://boysvswomen.com/#/). Men have 61% more muscle mass [(Lassek & Gaulin, 2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513809000397?via%3Dihub), and lower fat mass and higher mineral mass after adjusting for height [(Wells, 2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521690X07000371?via%3Dihub).

Fat free mass and limb muscle volume in men are significant predictors of the numbers of total and past-year self-reported sex partners, as well as age at first intercourse, suggesting that sexual selection may have contributed to these physical sex differences [(Lassek & Gaulin, 2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513809000397?via%3Dihub).

## Psychological

### Brain Differences

Neural networks utilizing neuroimaging can successfully differentiate between a male brain and a female brain with 93.3% accuracy [(Xin et al., 2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00185/full). There is immense overlap between the brains of men and women however [(Joel et al., 2015)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1509654112).

**There are a very wide number of documented sex differences which exist in the brain, many of which are tied to functions which may explain differences between men and women in certain tasks, with men excelling and some and women excelling at others.**

**Moreover, models have been developed which can predict a person's sex based on certain pieces of information about the brain such as MRI scans or electroencephalogram data with up to 96% accuracy, suggesting that these differences are not trivial.**

[Study of 15,847 people worldwide uncovers sex differences in the asymmetry of major brain structures](https://www.psypost.org/2017/08/study-15847-people-worldwide-uncovers-sex-differences-asymmetry-major-brain-structures-49459)

-   "Among the brain structures analysed, asymmetry in the globus pallidus, putamen, hippocampus and thalamus were the most strongly inherited. Meaning that these subcortical brain regions are the most likely to influence cognition and vulnerability to brain disorders though genetic variation. These findings are in agreement with multiple twin-based studies which have also found that genetics play a part in varying the asymmetry of subcortical structures like the amygdala."

[Brain Connectivity Study Reveals Striking Differences Between Men and Women](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2013/december/brain-connectivity-study-revea)

-   "In one of the largest studies looking at the "connectomes" of the sexes, Ragini Verma, PhD, an associate professor in the department of Radiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and colleagues found greater neural connectivity from front to back and within one hemisphere in males, suggesting their brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action. In contrast, in females, the wiring goes between the left and right hemispheres, suggesting that they facilitate communication between the analytical and intuition."

-   ""These maps show us a stark difference--and complementarity--in the architecture of the human brain that helps provide a potential neural basis as to why men excel at certain tasks, and women at others," said Verma."

-   "For instance, on average, men are more likely better at learning and performing a single task at hand, like cycling or navigating directions, whereas women have superior memory and social cognition skills, making them more equipped for multitasking and creating solutions that work for a group. They have a mentalistic approach, so to speak."

[Predicting sex from brain rhythms with deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21495-7)

-   "Here we show, in a ground truth scenario, that a deep neural net can predict sex from scalp electroencephalograms with an accuracy of >80% (p < 10-5), revealing that brain rhythms are sex specific."

[Functional connectivity predicts gender: Evidence for gender differences in resting brain connectivity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29322586/)

-   "By applying a predefined functional template and partial least squares regression modeling, we achieved a gender prediction accuracy of 87% when multi-run rfMRI was used. Permutation tests confirmed that gender prediction was reliable ( p<.001)."

[Patterns in the human brain mosaic discriminate males from females](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1523888113)

-   "To demonstrate this, we acquired T1-weighted structural MRI scans for 1,566 individuals, aged 19--35 y (57.7% female), from the freely available Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (3). Cortical thickness and subcortical volume estimates were calculated using the FreeSurfer automatic segmentation algorithm (v5.3; surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki). First, 400 subjects were retained as a held-out validation set. Next, penalized logistic regression [elastic net (4, 5)] was used to predict the sex of each individual based on their mosaic, or pattern, of morphometric brain data. Within the training set (n = 1,166), a regression model was built using three repeats of 10-fold cross-validation. The model was then used, without modification, to predict the sex of each individual in the held-out sample. Classification accuracy was extremely high [accuracy: 93%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 89.5--94.9%, P < 10-16] and remained significant if head-size-related measurements were excluded [92% (CI 88.9--94.5%), P < 10-16] or regressed out [70% (CI 65.0--74.2%), P < 10-6]. To borrow the framing of Joel et al. (1), the human brain may be a mosaic, but it is one with predictable patterns."

[Neuroanatomical morphometric characterization of sex differences in youth using statistical learning](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29414494/)

-   "The trained model exhibited an 83% cross-validated prediction accuracy, and correctly predicted the sex of 77% of the subjects from the independent multi-site dataset. Results showed that cortical thickness of the middle occipital lobes and the angular gyri are major predictors of sex."

[Gender Identification of Human Cortical 3-D Morphology Using Hierarchical Sparsity](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00029/full)

-   "We suggested a multivariate pattern analysis method called Hierarchical Sparse Representation Classifier (HSRC) and got an accuracy of 96.77% for gender identification."

-   "Our study indicates that gender can be identified on individual level by using cortical 3-D morphology and offers a new approach for structural MRI research, as well as highlights the importance of gender balance in brain imaging studies."

### Personality

**Research has overwhelmingly suggested that psychological sex differences exist in terms of personality (many papers use gender instead of sex, given that biological and sex converge upon one another 99% of the time, it's reasonable to treat these as synonymous for the purposes of our discussion). The most notable sex differences occur on the aggregate big five personality trait measures of neuroticism and agreeableness.**

[Gender differences in personality: a meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7809307/)

-   Meta-analysis

-   Finds that males are more assertive and have slightly higher self-esteem than females.

-   Females were higher than males in extraversion, anxiety, trust, and nurturance

-   There were no differences in social anxiety, impulsiveness, activity, reflectiveness, locus of control, and orderliness

-   These differences were generally constant across ages, time, educational levels, and nations

[Gender differences in personality across the ten aspects of the Big Five](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00178/full)

-   "Replicating previous findings, women reported higher Big Five Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism scores than men. However, more extensive gender differences were found at the level of the aspects, with significant gender differences appearing in both aspects of every Big Five trait. For Extraversion, Openness, and Conscientiousness, the gender differences were found to diverge at the aspect level, rendering them either small or undetectable at the Big Five level."

-   "Women scored higher than men on Enthusiasm, Compassion, Politeness, Orderliness, Volatility, Withdrawal, and Openness. Men scored higher than women on Assertiveness and Intellect. This indicates that the two aspects of Extraversion (Enthusiasm and Assertiveness) and the two aspects of Openness/Intellect display gender differences in opposite directions. Such divergence in gender differences at the aspect level helps to elucidate the small effect of the gender difference in overall Extraversion and the lack of a significant gender difference in Openness/Intellect."

-   "Although Intellect includes perceptions of cognitive ability and is more strongly associated with IQ scores than Openness (DeYoung et al., submitted), the fact that men score higher than women in Intellect should not be taken as indicative of greater intelligence for men than women. Gender differences in general intelligence are negligible, although men are typically found to show more variance in scores than women (Deary et al., 2007; van der Sluis et al., 2008). However, our findings are consistent with the finding that men show higher self-estimates of intelligence than women, across cultures (von Stumm et al., 2009). This pattern has been described as one of male hubris and female humility in relation to intelligence. The gender difference in Intellect probably reflects these biases related to confidence in intellectual abilities."

**I'm fairly interested in investigating the degree to which these differences are a result of biology as opposed to socialization. I would first point out that such differences are extremely large, which means that any social force which 100% accounts for sex differences in personality must also be extremely large to push men and women into certain personality traits.**

[The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029265)

-   "Personality measures were obtained from a large US sample (N = 10,261) with the 16PF Questionnaire. Multigroup latent variable modeling was used to estimate sex differences on individual personality dimensions, which were then aggregated to yield a multivariate effect size (Mahalanobis D). We found a global effect size D = 2.71, corresponding to an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions. Even excluding the factor showing the largest univariate ES, the global effect size was D = 1.71 (24% overlap). These are extremely large differences by psychological standards."

**These differences do not vary significantly by age, and are more pronounced as cultures become more egalitarian. There are a wide variety of explanations for this precise finding, with a lot of research consistent or inconsistent with any given theory. However, if it is the case that there are at least some sex differences in personality across all cultures, and these are all in the same direction of men scoring higher or lower on a given measure in each culture, it seems fair to suggest that socializing factors cannot fully explain these differences in personality.**

[Sex differences in 30 facets of the five factor model of personality in the large public (N = 320,128)](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/personality/2018-kajonius.pdf)

-   "Overall, across age-groups 19--69 years old, women scored notably higher than men in Agreeableness (d = 0.58) and Neuroticism (d = 0.40). Specifically, women scored d > 0.50 in facet traits Anxiety, Vulnerability, Openness to Emotions, Altruism, and Sympathy, while men only scored slightly higher (d > 0.20) than women in facet traits Excitement-seeking and Openness to Intellect. Sex gaps in the five trait domains were fairly constant across all age-groups, with the exception for age-group 19--29 years old."

-   "Interestingly, Neuroticism was, unlike Agreeableness, not uniformly different between sexes across the age-spans, with the largest gap found in the late teens, narrowing and stabilizing first at around 45 years of age. According to a broad evolutionary perspective, this trend seems to coincide with female sexual fertility. In this phase of life, females tend to be more vulnerable than males, in regard to the heightened male sexual aggression (Archer, 2004), while simultaneously investing in pregnancy and caring for infants (Wood & Eagly, 2002). Having women more disposed to anxiety (and empathy), while men are more disposed to assertiveness, may have been an optimal strategy for the propagation of the human species. Certainly, part of the sex gap could also be explained by cultural factors, such as young men not admitting to questionnaire-items assessing neuroticism. However, this explanation may not be supported by other-reports and behavioral observation (Vianello et al., 2013)."

[Gender differences in personality traits across cultures: robust and surprising findings](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11519935/)

-   "Women reported themselves to be higher in Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Warmth, and Openness to Feelings, whereas men were higher in Assertiveness and Openness to Ideas. Contrary to predictions from evolutionary theory, the magnitude of gender differences varied across cultures. Contrary to predictions from the social role model, gender differences were most pronounced in European and American cultures in which traditional sex roles are minimized."

-   "Analyses of cultural variation in gender differences showed that differentiation is both reliable and general. College-age men and women from each culture show the same magnitude of gender differences as do their adult counterparts, and cultures that show large differences on one variable tend to show large differences on others."

-   "That fact makes some explanations unlikely. Differences across cultures in the frequency of psychiatric diagnoses might be due to differential access to healthcare (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987), but that could not easily explain differences in A. Yet the same cultures that find little difference between the sexes in N also find little difference in A, and in composites of facets from E and O. Somebroader explanation seems to be needed"

-   "One possible explanation is that these results are artifactual.Perhaps in traditional cultures, where clear sex role differences are prescribed, self-descriptions are based on comparisons of the self with others of the same gender."

-   "However, if cultural differences in gender differentiation were due solely to the adoption of different standards of comparison,then gender stereotypes would not be affected, because questionsabout stereotypes require the respondent explicitly to contrast thesexes. Yet Williams and Best (1990) also found that gender ste-reotypes were most differentiated in Western, individualistic cultures."

-   "Another possibility is that personality traits in general are less relevant to members of collectivist cultures (Cross & Markus,1999), and thus relatively subtle gender differences may simply not be noticed. Church and Katigbak (2000), however, in their review of trait psychology in one collectivist culture, the Philip-pines, disputed that claim. Observer-rating data, particularly from observers outside the culture, might help resolve this issue."

-   "It is possible that gender differences in personality are geneti-cally determined, and that variations in gender differentiation area result of differences in gene pools between European and non-European countries."

-   "A final, and perhaps most plausible, explanation relies on attri-bution processes (Weiner, 1990). In individualistic, egalitarian countries, an act of kindness by a woman may be perceived (by her and others) as a free choice that must reflect on her personality.The same act by a woman in a collectivistic, traditional country might be dismissed as mere compliance with sex role norms. Thus,real differences in behavior might be seen everywhere, but would be attributed to roles rather than traits in traditional cultures."

[Sex differences in personality are larger in gender equal countries: Replicating and extending a surprising finding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30206941/)

-   "women typically score higher than men on all five trait factors (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness), and that these relative differences are larger in more gender equal countries. We speculate that as gender equality increases both men and women gravitate towards their traditional gender roles."

[Why can't a man be more like a woman? Sex differences in Big Five personality traits across 55 cultures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18179326/)

-   "Overall, higher levels of human development--including long and healthy life, equal access to knowledge and education, and economic wealth--were the main nation-level predictors of larger sex differences in personality. Changes in men's personality traits appeared to be the primary cause of sex difference variation across cultures. It is proposed that heightened levels of sexual dimorphism result from personality traits of men and women being less constrained and more able to naturally diverge in developed nations. In less fortunate social and economic conditions, innate personality differences between men and women may be attenuated."

[Does Gender Equality Cause Gender Differences in Values? Reassessing the Gender-Equality-Personality Paradox](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337752795_Does_Gender_Equality_Cause_Gender_Differences_in_Values_Reassessing_the_Gender-Equality-Personality_Paradox)

-   "Using data from all eight rounds of the European Social Survey (n = 235,339) across 32 European countries, we report three findings. First, in accordance with the evolutionary perspective, country-level gender equality is positively associated with gender differences in basic human values. Second, in accordance with the biosocial perspective, we find evidence supporting gender convergence in basic human values. Third, contradicting both evolutionary and biosocial assumptions, we find no evidence that gender equality causes gender differences in values."

-   "Looking across time, we found evidence of a gender con-vergence rather than divergence in values, with an average 15% reduction in Cohen's d between first and last measure-ment for the five value domains."

**Therefore, it appears reasonable to assert that there are sex differences in personality, and that these are partially but not entirely explained by biological differences between the sexes.**

[Gender differences in extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism in 37 nations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9200973/)

-   Looks at mean gender differences in extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism for 37 nations

-   Women had higher neuroticism in all countries

-   Men had higher psychoticism in 34 countries

-   Men had higher extraversion in 30 countries

### Interests

**Men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people. This gender difference is consistent across cultures and time, which suggests there is at least a partially biological cause for it.**

[Men and Things, Women and People: A Meta-Analysis of Sex Differences in Interests](https://web.archive.org/web/20180831133832/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/47af/4a7e87267aba681fb6971590ec80effce0c3.pdf)

-   Meta-analysis

-   Finds that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people.

[Gender Differences in Personality and Interests: When, Where, and Why?](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x)

-   "gender differences on the people--things dimension of interests are 'very large' (d = 1.18), with women more people-oriented and less thing-oriented than men."

-   "gender differences in interests appear to be consistent across cultures and over time, a finding that suggests possible biologic influences."

### Aggression

**Men in general are more aggressive than women, especially in terms of physical aggression. However, the difference becomes less clear when discussing more social forms of aggression. The overall difference in aggression can at least in part be explained by differences between men and women in testosterone, which has been found to predict aggression.**

[The relationship between testosterone and aggression: a meta-analysis](https://www.academia.edu/22213818/The_relationship_between_testosterone_and_aggression_a_meta-analysis)

-   Meta-analysis of 45 studies

-   Finds a weak but positive relationship between testosterone and aggression

[Testosterone and aggression: A reanalysis of Book, Starzyk, and Quinsey's (2001) study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257525063_Testosterone_and_aggression_A_reanalysis_of_Book_Starzyk_and_Quinsey%27s_2001_study)

-   "We identified the following problems with their analysis: Secondary, rather than primary, sources were used in the initial literature review; 15 studies were included that should have been omitted; there were no decision rules for calculating effect sizes, leading to inaccuracies in most of these; the statistical test used to compare categories was of low power; the coding of study characteristics was inaccurate. A reanalysis that corrected these problems produced a lower mean weighted correlation (r=.08 instead of the reported r=.14). The conclusions from our categorical comparisons were different from those of Book et al.: Neither of their positive findings (a decline with age; lower correlations in morning than afternoon samples) were confirmed."

[Typical testosterone levels in males and females](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323085)

-   "Adult males typically have between 265 and 923 nanograms per deciliter of testosterone in their blood, while adult females have far less. Levels vary widely between individuals and throughout a person's life."

[Gender and aggressive behavior: A meta-analytic review of the social psychological literature](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-10140-001)

-   Meta-analysis

-   Finds that men are somewhat more aggressive than women on average, particularly for aggression that produced physical injury or pain compared with aggression that produced psychological or social harm

-   This is a function of perceived consequences of aggression that are learned as aspects of gender roles and other social roles.

[The "sword of a woman": Gossip and female aggression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359178914000329?via%3Dihub)

-   Women are more likely than men to use gossip in an aggressive, competitive manner.

[Examining Sex Differences in the Use of Direct and Indirect Aggression](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12147-008-9065-5)

-   "Our first finding that males reported significantly higher use of the most serious form of aggression "beating up another kid" confirms once again that boys do indeed consistently engage in the more serious physical forms of aggression more often than girls do."

-   "As well, based on our examination of preferences for the use of the various behaviors we studied, girls prefer direct aggression to indirect aggression just as boys do."

-   "We also found that both males and females crossed gender lines with respect to the sex of target of aggression, but that girls are more willing to cross those gender lines than boys."

##IMAGE

-   "In our survey, direct aggression included pushing/shoving, swearing at another person, threatening, and name-calling. Indirect aggression included spreading rumors, excluding/shunning, damaging property, and blackmailing."

### Motor Control

**Men and women appear to have differences in terms of motor control. While overall, there is no clear sex difference, women perform better on fine motor skills, while men perform better on targeting and throwing accuracy. This latter finding exists at an early age, suggesting it has at least a partial biological origin.**

[Sex Differences: Summarizing More Than a Century of Scientific Research](https://archive.org/details/pdfy-VLw_XW3rMqu7yygj/mode/1up)

##IMAGE

[Gender Differences in Children's Throwing Performance: Biology and Environment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261570835_Gender_Differences_in_Children%27s_Throwing_Performance_Biology_and_Environment)

-   "Girls' throwing performance was only 57% that of boys, but when throwing was adjusted for a linear composite of biological variables, girls' throwing performance increased to 69% of boys'. Thus, while the differences in most motor performance tasks between boys and girls prior to puberty have been attributed to environmental factors, some of the differences in throwing performance appears to reflect biological characteristics, even as early as 5 years of age."

**There is some speculation that the male advantage in throwing might be caused by better spatial abilities in men, although empirical evidence on this appears to be mixed as far as I can tell. I'm agnostic on this hypothesis at the moment.**

[Spatial ability and throwing accuracy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01065771)

-   "Significant correlations have been found between several tests of throwing accuracy and spatial ability. This replicates an earlier finding and supports the hypothesis that past selection acting on hunting skills in males may partly account for the superior spatial ability observed in males today."

[Nontrivial sex differences in throwing and intercepting: Relation to psychometrically-defined spatial functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/019188699190053E?via%3Dihub)

-   "In contrast to the large sex differences found for the motor tasks, only weak trends were found on the paper-and-pencil spatial tests."

-   "Thus, target-directed motor tasks may employ a type of spatial function that is somewhat separable from traditionally-measured spatial abilities."

### Mental Health

Women tend to have worse mental health than men, having higher levels of anxiety and depression than men [(Eaton et al., 2011;](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2011/08/mental-illness)  [Salk et al., 2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5532074/). These differences are largely ubiquitous cross-culturally, although more gender equal countries have larger gender gaps on mental health outcomes [(Campbell et al., 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827321000173). Higher GDP per capita is also associated with worse average mental health and a larger gender gap in mental health.
In spite of all of this, men have higher suicide rates [(Crump et al., 2013)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/sociodemographic-psychiatric-and-somatic-risk-factors-for-suicide-a-swedish-national-cohort-study/38C261DEB9A28F6D244169B517227414). While women attempt suicide more, men have higher levels of complelted suicides [(Governors State University, n.a.)](https://www.govst.edu/suicide-prevention/).

### Intelligence

Male and female children tend to have roughly similar overall intelligence with each sex outperforming the other in certain forms of intelligence [(Giofrè et al., 2022)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-022-09705-1).  Women have a very small advantage in verbal ability [(Hyde & Linn, 1988)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232528001_Gender_Differences_in_Verbal_Ability_A_Meta-Analysis). They have better reading comprehension and writing ability [(Goldman, 2017)](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different/).  Men have an advantage in visuo-spatial abilities [(Voyer et al., 1995;](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.117.2.250)  [Voyer, 2011;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-010-0042-0)  [Voyer et al., 2016)](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-016-1085-7).  Women have an advantage in verbal episodic-memory tasks but have a disadvantage in episodic-memory tasks requiring both verbal and visuospatial processing [(Herlitz & Rehnman, 2008)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00547.x). Women outperform men in fine motor coordination and perceptual speed [(Goldman, 2017)](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different/).

Men have significantly more gray matter in the brain, while women have significantly more white matter, suggesting that while there are essentially no disparities in general intelligence the ways in which that intelligence manifests itself is different [(Haier et al., 2005)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050121100142.htm).  There is greater male than female variability in regional brain structure across the lifespan, which suggests that men may have higher variability in their intelligence than women [(Wierenga et al., 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.25204).
