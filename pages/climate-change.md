## **Effects of Climate Change**

### **Droughts**

Droughts have increased in frequency worldwide and have become more intense [(Hille, 2017;](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-finds-drought-in-eastern-mediterranean-worst-of-past-900-years) [Marvel et al., 2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1149-8). Projections indicate that these will likely increase over time [(Cook et al., 2015)](https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.1400082). Although these projections look at one region of the United States, it seems reasonable to assert similar trends will likely occur in other places given the increased droughts worldwide. Increases in droughts that have already occurred have likely caused or contributed to conflict in already unstable regions, with [Kelley et al. (2014)](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241) finding that the 2007-2010 drought contributed to the conflict in Syria.

## **Climate Model Accuracy**

While it is the case that short-term weather forecasts are bad at predicting future weather events and temperatures, climate models which look in the long-term have been as a whole very accurate at measuring temperature trends over time [(SkepticalScience, 2015;](https://skepticalscience.com/ipcc-global-warming-projections.htm) [Hausfather, 2019)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL085378).

The reason why weather can't really be predicted with current modelling while climate can is because climate models take the average of a number of weather events over time and use that to predict mean temperature trends [(SkepticalScience, 2023)](https://skepticalscience.com/climate-models.htm). This is similar to how a person can't with certainty predict the outcome of a coin toss but can predict the number of heads and tails of a coin toss over a large number of trials with a fair degree of certainty. Moreover, it should be noted that, at least regarding the IPCC predictions, sea level rise and arctic sea ice models have underestimated the climate response, as they failed to take into account positive feedback loops that exist with such phenomena [(SkepticalScience, 2023)](https://skepticalscience.com/climate-models.htm).
